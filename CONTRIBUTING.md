## Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#) to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of interest to the project. After discussion, you may then start to work on a Pull Request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The Pull Request will be merged once it has the sign-off of two core developers, or if it's a trivial change, it may be merged by a single core developer.

## Getting Started

Please check out our [documentation](#) for getting set up with development.

## Coding Standards
