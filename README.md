# StreamETH

This blockchain space has a very remote culture. Even events that are held physically still want to give remote attendees an experience as close to being physically present as possible. While solutions such as YouTube or other social media ‘Live’ media broadcasting solutions exist, they do not align with the core values of decentralization.

This open-source live-streaming and playback solution utilizes decentralized technologies and infrastructure that allows event hosts to easily spin up an environment for their virtual attendees.
