  "name": "Putting the \"design\" in mechanism design: tracing the evolution of economics as a design language. ",
  "description": "The digital world increasingly requires us to design \"economic engines\": computational abstractions that find optimal ways allocate resources. This talk traces the origins of \"economic engineering\" and delineates the directions in which economics has to evolve to become a design language, and conversely, how engineers can adopt economic concepts in their design work.",
