    "description": "At Sovereign Nature Initiative, we develop the Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP) with the goal of flipping the economics of ecology. Our approach facilitates the flow of value between ecological work and digital creativity, enabling sustainable validation of ecological efforts. By effectively integrating ecological work with the digital realm through processing eco-data, we not only generate value, but we also imbue digital assets with tangible and real-life significance.",
