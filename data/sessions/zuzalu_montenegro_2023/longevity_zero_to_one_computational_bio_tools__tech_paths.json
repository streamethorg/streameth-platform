  "description": "Session 11: Computational Bio &amp; Tech Paths\n\n\nThis session has two parts. Part 1 covers topics in computational biology. Part 2 covers alternative tech development paths adjacent to longevity.&nbsp;\n\nTopics:\n\n- Computational modeling\n- Machine learning\n- Full computation bio models\n- Hibernation\n- Cryonics\n- Uploading\n- Prosthetics\n- Synthetic organs&nbsp;\n\nAbout the course\n\n\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\n\nIf you donâ€™t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!",
