People will tell you that they are less stressed about rent, that they can pay for college now, and can take care of their kids better.\nBut six months after building this team, the company I worked at had a potential contract from an advertisement firm that said it could use our AI automations and then fire hundreds of their employees in the Philippines.&nbsp;\nThe race is on to build systems that distribute the benefits of AI.&nbsp;\nHow do we decentralize the data ownership, the compute, and the equity of AI?&nbsp;\nAre current efforts in AI safety centralizing AI in unhelpful ways?&nbsp;\nAs well as presenting an overview of some of these questions, we will give free access to a proprietary no-code tool to easily prototype your own AI apps.\nRather than being in fear of being made irrelevant, we can empower people to be builders.&nbsp;","start":"2023-05-04T09:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-05-04T10:00:00.000Z","stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"noah_chon_lee","name":"Noah Chon Lee","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/1356ixuh9clzzlgs/index.m3u8","playbackId":"1356ixuh9clzzlgs","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023"}
