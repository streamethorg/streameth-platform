  "description": "Session 9: Bioengineering / bioinformatics\n\n\nThis session has two parts. Part 1 covers common topics and challenges in engineering biological systems. Part 2 is an overview of bioinformatics work. Topics:\n\n\n- Bioengineering overview\n- Gene editing\n- Gene delivery\n- Bioinformatics&nbsp;\n\nAbout the course\n\n\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\n\nIf you donâ€™t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!",
