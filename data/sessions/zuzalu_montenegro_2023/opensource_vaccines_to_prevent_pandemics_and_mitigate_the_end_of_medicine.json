Vaccines designed to be broadly-protective against entire families of high-risk pathogens so as to preempt and mitigate the emergence of new disease risks are just now becoming possible with the help of novel computational antigen design strategies and fast-iteration nucleic acid platforms. Soham Sankaran from PopVax (https://popvax.com), an Indian mRNA vaccine company based in Hyderabad currently in the process of taking its pan-betacoronavirus vaccine candidate into US clinical trials this year, will talk about their approach to designing and manufacturing these broadly-protective vaccines, as well as their commitment to open-sourcing their designs and processes in order to ensure comprehensive low-cost global access to these medicines without delay, in particular in lower-income countries which are generally the last to be able to benefit from new medical advances.","start":"2023-05-12T08:30:00.000Z","end":"2023-05-12T09:30:00.000Z","stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"vitalik","name":"Vitalik","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"},{"id":"soham_sankaran","name":"Soham Sankaran","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/70d9e5sraw36pqcu/index.m3u8","playbackId":"70d9e5sraw36pqcu","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023"}
