How do you tell good science from bad? This session covers common ways science is misinterpreted, misaligned, and what to watch out for as you navigate the longevity science landscape.&nbsp;\n\nTopics:\n- Failed aging theories\n- Reproducibility crisis\n- Artisanal science\n- Bad incentives\n- Low impact work vs high impact work\n\nAbout the course\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\nIf you don’t have a biology background, we highly recommend attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!","start":"2023-05-08T08:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-05-08T16:00:00.000Z","stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"cat_thu","name":"Cat Thu","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"},{"id":"ksenia_winslow","name":"Ksenia Winslow","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/bfcfgytrfwmihpr6/index.m3u8","playbackId":"bfcfgytrfwmihpr6","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023"}
