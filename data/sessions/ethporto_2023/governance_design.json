  "description": "This workshop is designed for professionals and enthusiasts who want to gain a deeper understanding of governance design and its applications. We will look into building a (very rough) MVP on different problem spaces, such as: \n- Consensus-seeking in a DAO \n- Distributing decision-making and budgets across a DAO \n- Developing governance tools - Delegation: incentives, accountability, and different mechanisms \n- Continuous improvement in governance structures \n- Using game theory to develop robust decision-making structures \n- Ensuring accountability and transparency in the design process \n- Creating incentives for participation \n- Cross-coordination between scopes / departments / guilds The workshop will be led by a team of experts from the MakerDAO Ecosystem Cluster and DAOcraft.cx who have extensive experience in governance design. They will share their knowledge and insights with you, and provide you with practical tools and techniques that you can use in your own work.\n\nPlease note that the workshop will not be recorded or streamed.
