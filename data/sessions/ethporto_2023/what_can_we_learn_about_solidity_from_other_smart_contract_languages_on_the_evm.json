  "name": "What Can We Learn About Solidity from Other Smart Contract Languages on the EVM",
  "description": "The workshop will walk you through creating a smart contract in 4 different languages targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In each case you will learn what makes the language unique compared to Solidity. Some of these languages are viable alternatives today, some are already dead, but all of them are good examples of how the same problem can be approached from completely different directions. \n\nThe goal of the workshop is not just to get you to know smart contracts as they are today, but to give you some perspective on how they could be, and encourage you to participate in shaping their future.\n\nWorkshops will not be streamed or recorded. It will be held in English and no translation to Portuguese will be provided.",
