  "description": "Session 7: Models and Biomarkers\nHow do we tell if longevity interventions are extending our lifespans? By definition, to observe lifespan extension we will need to wait a lifetime. This session discusses approaches we use to shorten experiment time.\n\nTopics:\n- Animal models\n- Organoids / ex-vivo models\n- Biomarkers\n- Clocks\n- Omits / network\n\nAbout the course:\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\nIf you donâ€™t have a biology background, we highly recommend attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!",
