  "description": "Session 2: Aging Biology\n\nThis session discusses what aging is, how we can learn from aging variations between species, and a few aging theories.\n\nTopics:\n- Why we age\n- What is aging\n- Information theory\n- Damage accumulation theory\n- Intra- and inter-species variability\n- Immuneaging\n\n\nAbout the course:\n\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\nIf you donâ€™t have a biology background, we highly recommend attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology).
