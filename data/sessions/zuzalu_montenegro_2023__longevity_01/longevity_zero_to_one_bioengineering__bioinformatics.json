{"id":"longevity_zero_to_one_bioengineering__bioinformatics","name":"Longevity Zero to One: Bioengineering / Bioinformatics","description":"Session 9: Bioengineering / bioinformatics\n\n\nThis session has two parts. Part 1 covers common topics and challenges in engineering biological systems. Part 2 is an overview of bioinformatics work. Topics:\n\n\n- Bioengineering overview\n- Gene editing\n- Gene delivery\n- Bioinformatics\n\nAbout the course\n\n\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\n\nIf you don’t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!","start":"2023-05-09T13:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-05-09T14:00:00.000Z","stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"cat_thu","name":"Cat Thu","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__longevity_01"},{"id":"ksenia_winslow","name":"Ksenia Winslow","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__longevity_01"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/56e0d7fwikgs9fbs/index.m3u8","playbackId":"56e0d7fwikgs9fbs","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__longevity_01","coverImage":"/sessions/zuzalu_montenegro_2023__longevity_01/longevity_zero_to_one_bioengineering__bioinformatics.jpg"}
