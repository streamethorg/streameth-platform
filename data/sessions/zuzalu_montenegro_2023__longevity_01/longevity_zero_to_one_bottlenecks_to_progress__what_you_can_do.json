    "description": "Session 12: Bottlenecks to Progress &amp; What You Can Do\n\n\nThis session concludes the Longevity Zero to One course. We systematically go over important bottlenecks in longevity and discuss promising paths to unblock them.\n\nTopics:\n\n- Lack of good models and biomarkers\n- Lack of funding\n- Piecemeal science\n- Hype/herd mentality\n- Primitive tools\n- Personnel\n- Cultural aversion\n- Institutional misalignment\n- Lack of career / educational paths\n- Lack of public databases\n- Siloes\n- Lack of data standards\n- Lack of regulatory paths\n\nAbout the course\n\n\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!",
