However, each of us also faces an existential certainty: inevitable aging, disease, and death. Techno-optimists point out that advanced AI may be a key ingredient to radically accelerate progress in the development of novel therapies and medical practice.\n\nIn this short talk and group discussion, we will explore how advanced AI may transform medicine, identify opportunities and barriers, and develop ideas on how we can ensure that AI is developed and used in the most beneficial way possible.\n\nMatthias Samwald, PhD, is associate professor at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at the Medical University of Vienna. https://samwald.info/","start":1698928800000,"end":1698930600000,"stageId":"restaurant","speakers":[{"id":"matthias_samwald","name":"Matthias Samwald","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuconnect_istanbum__ai_track"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"zuconnect_istanbum__ai_track","coverImage":"/sessions/zuconnect_istanbum__ai_track/discussion_workshop_how_will_ai_radically_transform_medicine_within_our_lifetimes.jpg"}
