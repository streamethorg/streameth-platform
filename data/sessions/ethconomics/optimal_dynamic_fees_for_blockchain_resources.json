We will start with a broad introduction, then discuss a practical framework to derive optimal dynamic fees with multiple resources. I will present theoretical and empirical results derived using this framework and practical case studies of EIP-1559-style policies and multidimensional extensions such as EIP-4844.","start":1700047500000,"end":1700049000000,"stageId":"uskudar_3","speakers":[{"id":"davide_crapis","name":"Davide Crapis","bio":"Davide is a Research Scientist at the Robust Incentives Group within the Ethereum Foundation.
