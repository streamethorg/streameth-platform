    "name": "Arbitrageurs' profits, LVR, and sandwich attacks: batch trading as an AMM design response",
    "description": "In the first part of the presentation, I'll discuss how AMM design relates to sandwich attacks and LVR/Arbitrage profits/Impermanent loss. I will then present a recent research paper in which we show that batching trades (and designing an AMM around it) can eliminate both sandwich attacks and LVR/Arbitrage profits.",
