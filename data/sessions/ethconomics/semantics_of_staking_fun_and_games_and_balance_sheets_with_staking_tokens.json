  "description": "We continue our exploration of the various Principal-Agent problems at play in decentralised systems by shining a light on staking. We provide some thoughts prompted by an exercise in formalising existing constructions with a systematic review. We discuss architectures of liquid staking and re-staking, and everything in-between and beyond.",
