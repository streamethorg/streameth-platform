The speaker reflects on the idea that all atoms are local in biology, and how this could be a strategic alliance between biology and democracy. The speaker also discusses examples of bioengineering, such as using yeast cells to produce essential medical ingredients, and highlights the need for a networked biotechnology that is not currently being developed. The video ends with a reference to the Black Panther Party's public health clinics and their use of genomic diagnostic testing.","start":"2023-04-01T14:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-04-01T15:00:00.000Z","stageId":"ballroom","speakers":[{"id":"vitalik_buterin","name":"Vitalik Buterin","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__other"},{"id":"drew_endy","name":"Drew Endy","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__other"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/96daut16x6qr2iu7/index.m3u8","playbackId":"96daut16x6qr2iu7","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__other","coverImage":"/sessions/zuzalu_montenegro_2023__other/waterway_fireside_chat__a_decentralized_society_thats_built_with_biology.jpg"}
