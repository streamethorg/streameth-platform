  "description": "The video features a speaker discussing the potential of a \"bionet\" - a networked biotechnology that enables people to grow solutions where they are. The speaker reflects on the idea that all atoms are local in biology, and how this could be a strategic alliance between biology and democracy. The speaker also discusses examples of bioengineering, such as using yeast cells to produce essential medical ingredients, and highlights the need for a networked biotechnology that is not currently being developed. The video ends with a reference to the Black Panther Party's public health clinics and their use of genomic diagnostic testing.",
