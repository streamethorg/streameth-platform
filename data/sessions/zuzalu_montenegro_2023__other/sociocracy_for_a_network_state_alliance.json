  "description": "We will discuss how the Amazonian Woarani people organize through federations, how the Ashaninka indigenous people won a war using bows and arrows in the 90s against terrorists using community engagement, and how three million Kurds in northern Syria won against ISIS and established an autonomous region using sociocracy with zero central government. Then we shall consider how we might use these principles to form a network state alliance.&nbsp;",
