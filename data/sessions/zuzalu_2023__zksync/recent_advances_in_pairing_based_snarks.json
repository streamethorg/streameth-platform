{"id":"recent_advances_in_pairing_based_snarks","name":"Recent Advances in Pairing Based SNARKs","description":"In this video, the speaker provides an overview of the last decade of pairing-based snarks, focusing on the third chapter of this approach. They discuss the KZG polynomial commitment scheme and how it can be used to prove that a polynomial is equal to the vanishing polynomial of a subset of T in only O(S) operations. The speaker introduces the concept of fractional decomposition and explains how it can be used to compute the commitment to ZT minus S, which is a sparse combination of commitments that can be pre-computed.","start":"2023-04-19T13:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-04-19T14:00:00.000Z","stageId":"ballroom","speakers":[{"id":"ariel_gabizon","name":"Ariel Gabizon","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_2023__zksync","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/f3dcw5v0phzv01mi/index.m3u8","playbackId":"f3dcw5v0phzv01mi","eventId":"zuzalu_2023__zksync"}
