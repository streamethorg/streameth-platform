He emphasizes the need for better markets and better commons to solve big social problems. Potts suggests combining the properties of both markets and commons to create a new type of mechanism, which he refers to as an \"object-oriented economy.\" He explains that markets are efficient mechanisms for computing local information into prices, while commons provide better governance. Potts argues that by combining these two mechanisms, we can build next-generation economies that are more computationally complex and better equipped to address social and environmental challenges. He acknowledges that this idea is still experimental but believes that recent advancements in technology have made it possible to explore and implement these new types of mechanisms.\n\nIn this video, Jason Potts discusses the need for building new economies and the role of markets and commons in this process. He highlights the limitations of traditional economic systems and the importance of incorporating externalities and better governance. Potts proposes a new approach that combines the properties of both markets and commons, creating a new mechanism for economic coordination. He emphasizes the need for more compute in both markets and commons, suggesting that richer information sources are essential for solving big social problems. Potts also mentions the potential of Web 3 technologies in enabling this new type of mechanism. Overall, he argues that next-generation economies should be next-generation computers, combining decentralized mechanisms to create a more effective and inclusive economic system.\n\nIn this video, Jason Potts discusses the concept of building new economies for the future. He starts by explaining the current economic system, which is based on market economies and government intervention. However, he points out that this system has limitations, particularly in dealing with externalities. He then introduces the concept of commons, which refers to local governance systems for resources. Potts suggests that the future of economies lies in combining markets and commons into a new mechanism that can compute and coordinate economic activities more effectively. He emphasizes the need for better markets and better commons, both of which require more compute power. Potts proposes building an object-oriented economy that allows for the creation of multiple economies at different scales. He believes that combining market mechanisms with contributions from commons can lead to a new theory of value that incorporates richer information into prices. Potts concludes by stating that this approach to building next-generation economies is only possible now due to advancements in technology, particularly in terms of scalable compute components.","start":"2023-07-15T13:30:00.000Z","end":"2023-07-15T13:50:00.000Z","stageId":"farabeuf_amphitheater","speakers":[{"id":"jason_potts","name":"Jason Potts","bio":"No description","eventId":"funding_the_commons_paris_2023"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/03019i3fmbm75zdr/index.m3u8","playbackId":"03019i3fmbm75zdr","eventId":"funding_the_commons_paris_2023"}
