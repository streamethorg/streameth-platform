He discusses the historical significance of the location and its relation to the alignment between Ethere technology and the Paris Agreement. Haft explains that Ethere was initially developed as a transparent medium to spread ideas globally but lost its alignment with climate goals over time. Now, efforts are being made to address the carbon debt left behind by proof-of-work computing. Haft emphasizes collaboration among leading companies in the Ethere ecosystem to create an end-to-end solution for climate change. Rafael Haupt from Toucon is introduced as a new partner joining the Ethere climate platform, expressing excitement about using web3 technologies to address climate change. The video concludes with Haft highlighting the opportunity to build a trust layer for the planet and encouraging viewers to become stewards of that trust layer.","start":"2023-07-16T13:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-07-16T13:15:00.000Z","stageId":"farabeuf_amphitheater","speakers":[{"id":"steven_haft","name":"Steven Haft","bio":"No description","eventId":"funding_the_commons_paris_2023"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/865ahh8v25td2hk3/index.m3u8","playbackId":"865ahh8v25td2hk3","eventId":"funding_the_commons_paris_2023"}
