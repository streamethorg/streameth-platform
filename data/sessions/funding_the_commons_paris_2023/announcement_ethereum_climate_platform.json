  "description": "Stephen Haft, the head of global partnership and climate lead at ConsenSys, announces the Ethere climate platform in this video. He discusses the historical significance of the location and its relation to the alignment between Ethere technology and the Paris Agreement. Haft explains that Ethere was initially developed as a transparent medium to spread ideas globally but lost its alignment with climate goals over time. Now, efforts are being made to address the carbon debt left behind by proof-of-work computing. Haft emphasizes collaboration among leading companies in the Ethere ecosystem to create an end-to-end solution for climate change. Rafael Haupt from Toucon is introduced as a new partner joining the Ethere climate platform, expressing excitement about using web3 technologies to address climate change. The video concludes with Haft highlighting the opportunity to build a trust layer for the planet and encouraging viewers to become stewards of that trust layer.",
