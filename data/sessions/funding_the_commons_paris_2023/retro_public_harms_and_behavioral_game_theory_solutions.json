  "description": "In this video, the speaker discusses the application of behavioral game theory in the crypto-economic space. They emphasize the importance of finding a core game that lies at the heart of a strategic problem to effectively solve it. The speaker introduces the concept of introspective equilibria and how cultural information can play a role in coordination. They provide real-life examples, such as the Zuzalu event in Montenegro, to illustrate this theory. Additionally, the speaker explores the concept of altruistic sanctioning and its potential application in funding public goods and preventing Sybil attacks in crypto projects.",
