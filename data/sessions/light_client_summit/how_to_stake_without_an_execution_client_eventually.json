We dive into why execution clients are needed when staking today, and then enumerate which technologies are needed to drop the execution clients. We touch on Verkle tries, Proposer-Builder Separation, and the Portal Network. Each of these components will impact the staking community, but they are especially powerful when combined.","start":1700296200000,"end":1700297400000,"stageId":"3b36","speakers":[{"id":"jason_carver","name":"Jason Carver","bio":"Since 2017, Jason (aka Carver) has been at the Ethereum Foundation, working on a variety of Python projects including py-evm.
