  "description": "Execution clients are projected to take Terabytes of disk space, so let's get rid of them! We dive into why execution clients are needed when staking today, and then enumerate which technologies are needed to drop the execution clients. We touch on Verkle tries, Proposer-Builder Separation, and the Portal Network. Each of these components will impact the staking community, but they are especially powerful when combined.",

Over the last two years, he shifted to launching a Rust project called \"trin.\" trin is a pre-release client for the upcoming Portal network. This peer-to-peer network will provide on-demand access to core Ethereum chain data. We aim to provide a brand new way to read from the Layer 1 Ethereum network, that doesn't keep all the baggage of standard execution clients. ",
