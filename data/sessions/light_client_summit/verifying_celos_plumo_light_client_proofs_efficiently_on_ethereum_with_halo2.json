  "name": "Verifying Celo's Plumo light client proofs efficiently on Ethereum with Halo2",
  "description": "This talk would outline our experience building a Halo2 prover/verifier that can verify BW6 groth16 proofs efficiently on Ethereum, allowing us to verify Celo's Plumo light client proofs efficiently on Ethereum. With Celo transitioning to an L2 and validators transitioning to decentralized sequencers, this light client would transition to an efficient way to determine the Celo decentralized sequencer set on Ethereum.",
