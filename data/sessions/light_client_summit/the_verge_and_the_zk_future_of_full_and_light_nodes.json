    "description": "In this talk we will go over the Verge, the future of enshrined ZK in Ethereum, and what this means for full and light nodes. Along the way we will discuss ZK proving ethereum blocks, consensus/BLS signatures, and the cost of these operations. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable light clients to fully sync with Ethereum in a single ZK proof.",
