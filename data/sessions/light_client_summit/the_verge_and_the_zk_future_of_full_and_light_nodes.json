Along the way we will discuss ZK proving ethereum blocks, consensus/BLS signatures, and the cost of these operations. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable light clients to fully sync with Ethereum in a single ZK proof.","start":1700304000000,"end":1700305200000,"stageId":"3b36","speakers":[{"id":"steven_li","name":"Steven Li","bio":"Steven works at RISC Zero as part of growth where he primary focuses on product research and solutions architecture.
