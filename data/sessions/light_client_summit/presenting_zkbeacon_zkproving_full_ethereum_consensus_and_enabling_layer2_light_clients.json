  "name": "Presenting ZK-Beacon: ZK-proving Full Ethereum Consensus and Enabling Layer2 Light Clients\n",
  "description": "ZK-Beacon is a ZK-prover for full Ethereum consensus - an open source and public goods project we are working on. ZK-Beacon will enable us to generate a single ZK-proof that proves the entire Beacon Consensus. This will enable verifying the Beacon Consensus inside a smart contract, or on mobile phones. This is unlike the Altair light client, which inherits limited Ethereum security",
