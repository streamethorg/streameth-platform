With Celo transitioning to an L2 and validators transitioning to decentralized sequencers, this light client would transition to an efficient way to determine the Celo decentralized sequencer set on Ethereum.","start":1700302800000,"end":1700304000000,"stageId":"3b36","speakers":[{"id":"kobi_gurkan","name":"Kobi Gurkan","bio":"Kobi Gurkan is Head of Research at Geometry, puzzler at ZKHack, producing blocks at Zero Knowledge Validator, and cryptographer at cLabs.","eventId":"light_client_summit","twitter":"@kobigurk","photo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1450135683188854787/Gzb5--kd_400x400.jpg\n"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"light_client_summit","coverImage":"/sessions/light_client_summit/remote_presenter_verifying_celos_plumo_light_client_proofs_efficiently_on_ethereum_with_halo2.jpg"}
