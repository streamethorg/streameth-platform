The purpose of this talk is to showcase the most common vulnerabilities that are due to specificities and pitfalls of the actual Solidity language. This would be generally the results of a research study made on the language vulnerabilities found in audits (Solodit-based) and post audits (hacks and Immunefi report database). Some great language design decisions from a security perspective could also be presented.","start":1700130300000,"end":1700132100000,"stageId":"uskudar_2","speakers":[{"id":"gmhacker","name":"gmhacker","bio":"GMHacker is an aerospace engineer who worked on IoT and embedded systems, finances on a large European bank, and in the digital TV industry.
