  "description": "In today's crowded digital wallet landscape, potential adopters face an arduous choice of what wallet to take a look at, then, download or sign up, and hopefully, keep using again and again. As tech features and user experience define user retention, this is a product reputation that facilitates the “test drive”, or even a decision to stay on the product website longer or close the tab right away. \r\nAs with any other complex system, reputation can be reverse-engineered. When combined with speculative design techniques, these reverse-engineering results can give momentum to any new digital wallet — big or small, well-developed or buggy-alpha one— a chance to be considered along with widely used wallets. The only question: how fair is such reverse engineering?",
