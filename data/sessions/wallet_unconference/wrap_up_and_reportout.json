    "description": "There are eight timeslots, each with 3 or 4 workshops, meaning that if you attended the entire event, you could not possibly have seem more than one-third of this excellent top-shelf content, ideation, and conversation. Hopefully most of the sessions not recorded produced a page or three of notes.  Reporting out on the sessions helps everyone absorb more data, make mental notes about whom to talk to later, and state next steps into a microphone and youtube recording if they need an accountability anchor.",
