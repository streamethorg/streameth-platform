    "name": "CAIP-222 - Improving UX for Wallet authentication",
    "description": "The new CAIP-222 standard provides a simpler user experience by bundling two wallet requests (\"connect wallet\" and \"sign in with ethereum/solana/etc\") into a single method. This one-click flow can thus provide wallet authentication and even Authorization via ReCaps or UCANs when exposing blockchain accounts and returning a cryptographic signature. Cali will give a brief overview of the interface and then workshop use-cases with attendees.",
