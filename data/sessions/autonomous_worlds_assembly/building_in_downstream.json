  "description": "Open to anyone with a creative streak (provided you can find your command line), this hands-on coding session breaks down the core mechanic of our game, Downstream, where new functionality is added by creating an in-game building. We'll guide participants through loading the game, downloading our command line tool and example code, modifying that to create their own custom building, then deploying it and visiting it in-game.\n\nWe'll explore a few different things you can make these buildings do, from simple item factories to the more weird and wonderful, including making games for other people to play. Participants will need a WalletConnect compatible mobile app and a computer with npm installed.",
