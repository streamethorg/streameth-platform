    "description": "What do we actually mean by the word \"world\" in its varied usages across common language (such as \"in the real world\" or \"save the world\"), fiction (as in \"worldbuilding\"), simulation, immersive technologies like VR, generative AI, and technologies of trust, coordination, and commitment like blockchains (with and without zero-knowledge mechanisms)?
