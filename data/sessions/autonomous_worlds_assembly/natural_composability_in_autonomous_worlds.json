This world can then be permissionlessly extended through the introduction of new rules, all the while maintaining the integrity of existing ones. This approach allows anyone to extend the world without the need for an onchain API.\n\nThis presentation will describe how this mechanism works in practice and how it might be deployed elsewhere.","start":1700052300000,"end":1700053200000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"ronan_sandford","name":"Ronan Sandford","bio":"Ronan Sandford is the founder of Etherplay, where he has been building onchain games since 2016.
