{"id":"natural_composability_in_autonomous_worlds","name":"Natural Composability in Autonomous Worlds","description":"We are in the process of building Stratagems, a game whose straightforward initial rules allow players to create the world they play in. This world can then be permissionlessly extended through the introduction of new rules, all the while maintaining the integrity of existing ones. This approach allows anyone to extend the world without the need for an onchain API.\n\nThis presentation will describe how this mechanism works in practice and how it might be deployed elsewhere.","start":1700052300000,"end":1700053200000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"ronan_sandford","name":"Ronan Sandford","bio":"Ronan is the founder of Etherplay, building onchain games since 2016 and Autonomous Worlds since 2019 including ethernal.world, a fully onchain game where player proceduraly generate an infinite dungeon and conquest.game, a permission-less and persistent game of diplomacy without any central operator.\n\nHis latest is stratagems.world, exploring the latent composability in permission-less and persistent games.\n\nHe is also an active developer in the web3 space with contributions towards EIPs including ERC-1155 and ERC-2771, but also tools like hardhat-deploy and Jolly-Roger.\nHe has been tinkering with fully on-chain NFTs too with mandalas.eth and bleeps.art .\n\nYou can find more on his personal website: ronan.eth.limo","eventId":"autonomous_worlds_assembly","twitter":"@wighawag","photo":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FP3AD8iETQKTAwh4C3M8TXhoxcFwA5Ql"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"autonomous_worlds_assembly","coverImage":"/sessions/autonomous_worlds_assembly/natural_composability_in_autonomous_worlds.jpg"}
