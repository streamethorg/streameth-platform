    "description": "This session will present our learnings in developing an interactive fog of war for the onchain strategy game Network States, enabling player A to alter player B's shielded state. Going beyond pproaches solely reliant on zero-knowledge, fully homomorphic encryption, or multi-party computation, we chose a novel method that hinges on hardware-based trust for state concealment, supplemented with cryptographic and proof-of-stake assumptions.",
