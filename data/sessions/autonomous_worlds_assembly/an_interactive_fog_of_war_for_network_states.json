{"id":"an_interactive_fog_of_war_for_network_states","name":"An Interactive Fog of War for Network States","description":"This session will present our learnings in developing an interactive fog of war for the onchain strategy game Network States, enabling player A to alter player B's shielded state. Going beyond pproaches solely reliant on zero-knowledge, fully homomorphic encryption, or multi-party computation, we chose a novel method that hinges on hardware-based trust for state concealment, supplemented with cryptographic and proof-of-stake assumptions.\n","start":1700046900000,"end":1700047800000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"lyron_co_ting_keh","name":"Lyron Co Ting Keh","bio":"Areas of interest include recursion [eg.
