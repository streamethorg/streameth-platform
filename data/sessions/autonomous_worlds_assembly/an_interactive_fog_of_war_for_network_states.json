Going beyond pproaches solely reliant on zero-knowledge, fully homomorphic encryption, or multi-party computation, we chose a novel method that hinges on hardware-based trust for state concealment, supplemented with cryptographic and proof-of-stake assumptions.","start":1700046900000,"end":1700047800000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"lyron_co_ting_keh","name":"Lyron Co Ting Keh","bio":"Lyron Co Ting Keh is a developer at Seismic, a protocol for interactive shielding.","eventId":"autonomous_worlds_assembly","twitter":"@lyronctk","photo":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yoR5F6kopqDdNcPs-dsYtEl69kv1bL2M"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"autonomous_worlds_assembly","coverImage":"/sessions/autonomous_worlds_assembly/an_interactive_fog_of_war_for_network_states.jpg"}
