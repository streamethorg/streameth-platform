{"id":"zeroknowledge_machine_learning_for_autonomous_worlds","name":"Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning for Autonomous Worlds","description":"This talk will chart into the subtle but significant ways that zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) can be harnessed to create richer Autonomous Worlds. Three case studies will be presented:\n\n1. Developing standalone games where the ZKML model acts as the game world itself.\n2. Using ZKML to generate a world's lore and narrative.\n3. Employing ZKML to establish \"\"onchain physics\"\" where the model sets the world's state.\n\nThe session will be accompanied by a hands-on workshop guiding participants through development and deployment.","start":1700045100000,"end":1700046000000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"dante","name":"Dante","bio":"Dante is currently building EZKL, a library for zero-knowledge computation.
