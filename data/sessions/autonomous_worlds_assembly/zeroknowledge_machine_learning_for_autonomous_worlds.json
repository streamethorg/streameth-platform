    "description": "This talk will chart into the subtle but significant ways that zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) can be harnessed to create richer Autonomous Worlds. Three case studies will be presented:\n\n1. Developing standalone games where the ZKML model acts as the game world itself.\n2. Using ZKML to generate a world's lore and narrative.\n3. Employing ZKML to establish \"\"onchain physics\"\" where the model sets the world's state.\n\nThe session will be accompanied by a hands-on workshop guiding participants through development and deployment.",
