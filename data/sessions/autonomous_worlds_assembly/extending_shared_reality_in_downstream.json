    "description": "Worlds that exist onchain are composable and interoperable by default, allowing people to build on top of what exists already. Yet, because of how plug-ins and mods work elsewhere, we tend to think of extensions as optional things that players can use to customise their individual experience. In this talk, we'll focus on how we've elevated extensions to a primary role in our game, Downstream. This approach allows players to update a shared reality, not just their individual experience of it.",
