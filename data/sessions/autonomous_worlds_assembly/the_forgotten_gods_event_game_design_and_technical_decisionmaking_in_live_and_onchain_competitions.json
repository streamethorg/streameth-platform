  "description": "In this session, we’ll delve into the “Forgotten Gods” event, a three-week competition that unfolded within our onchain game, Pirate Nation. We’ll reflect on the intriguing social dynamics that emerged, such as faction-switching and player recruitment strategies, as well as the technical hurdles we faced, including issues like botting, community-created clients, and item burning. This discussion will provide valuable insights for developers interested in running their own engaging onchain game competitions.",
