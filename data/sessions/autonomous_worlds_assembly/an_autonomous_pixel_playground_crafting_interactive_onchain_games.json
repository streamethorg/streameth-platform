Conversations on this topic are frequently theoretical; our workshop aims to shift that narrative by discussing the different stages of designing and building interactive and interoperable games. Namely,\n\n1. Initiation and building.\n2. Evolution through cooperation of different game creators and players.\n3. Emergence of new, unexpected gaming experiences.","start":1700118000000,"end":1700121600000,"stageId":"beylerbeyi_1","speakers":[{"id":"john_k","name":"John K","bio":"John K is a product-centered entrpreneur with 5 years of experience in crafting consumer software products in Europe and Asia.
