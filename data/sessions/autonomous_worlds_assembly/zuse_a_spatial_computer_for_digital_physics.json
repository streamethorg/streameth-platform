  "description": "This workshop will introduce Zuse, a shared computer protocol for digital physics that uses spatial rather than Turing-complete computing. Using Zuse, one can deploy multiple coexisting worlds, each with its own unique physics. Within these worlds, players can create new content and host a variety of apps, each with distinct goals.",
