{"id":"zuse_a_spatial_computer_for_digital_physics","name":"Zuse: A Spatial Computer for Digital Physics","description":"This workshop will introduce Zuse, a shared computer protocol for digital physics that uses spatial rather than Turing-complete computing. Using Zuse, one can deploy multiple coexisting worlds, each with its own unique physics. Within these worlds, players can create new content and host a variety of apps, each with distinct goals.","start":1700128800000,"end":1700132400000,"stageId":"beylerbeyi_1","speakers":[{"id":"dhvani_patel","name":"Dhvani Patel","bio":"Co-founder of Tenet, building a shared computer protocol for digital physics.
