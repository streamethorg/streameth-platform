At the same time, content represented in such a way amplifies the importance of routing; hashes are hard to remember, content keeps increasing, data moves and so do peers. This begs the question: how would we find “stuff” fast, efficiently and reliably without enabling centralised snooping? Find out what the InterPlanetary Network Indexer is addressing this issue for IPFS and FileCoin network.","start":"2023-09-15T17:00:00+02:00","end":"2023-09-15T17:25:00+02:00","stageId":"atelier__side_stage","speakers":[{"id":"masih_derkani","name":"Masih Derkani","bio":"Masih Derkani is a computer scientist and software engineer with a passion for building decentralized systems. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of St. Andrews, where his research focused on the intersection of distributed systems and key-based routing in peer-to-peer networks. Masih is a core contributor to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the InterPlanetary Network Indexer (IPNI), and Filecoin decentralized storage network. Throughout his career, he has worked on numerous other decentralized projects with a focus on large-scale data-intensive systems and high availability. Masih is dedicated to advancing the development of decentralized web and has a proven track record of delivering innovative solutions to complex problems in this space.","eventId":"protocol_berg","photo":"https://speak.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/i3_6xFXZDN.jpg"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"protocol_berg","coverImage":"/sessions/protocol_berg/indexing_the_planet_for_good.jpg"}
