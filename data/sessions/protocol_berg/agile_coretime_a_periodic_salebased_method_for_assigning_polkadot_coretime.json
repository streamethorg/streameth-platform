  "description": "The \"Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer\" (or just Polkadot UC), represents the public service provided by the Polkadot Network: it is a trust-free, WebAssembly-based, multicore, internet-native omnipresent virtual machine which is highly resilient to interference and corruption. The present system of allocating resources of the Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer (parachain slot auctions) is based on a model of one-core-per-parachain: this is a legacy interpretation of the Polkadot platform and is not a reflection of its present capabilities. With Polkadot's capability to adapt to its users'need, a new paradign for allocating coretime is being implemented by ecosystem teams. Coretime on the Polkadot UC is envisioned to be sold by the Polkadot System in two separate formats: Bulk Coretime and Instantaneous Coretime. When a Polkadot Core is utilized, we say it is dedicated to a \"Task\" rather than a \"parachain\". The Task to which a Core is dedicated may change at every Relay-chain block and while one predominant type of Task is to secure a Cumulus-based blockchain (i.e. a parachain), other types of Tasks are envisioned. Bulk Coretime is sold periodically on a specialised system chain known as the \"Coretime-chain\" and allocated in advance of its usage, whereas Instantaneous Coretime is sold on the Relay-chain immediately prior to usage on a block-by-block basis.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to explain this paradigm change within the Polkadot community to adapt to end-user needs, provide more agility and reduce long-term design flows.",
