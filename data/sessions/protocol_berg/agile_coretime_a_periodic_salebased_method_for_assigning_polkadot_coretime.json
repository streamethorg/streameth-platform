The present system of allocating resources of the Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer (parachain slot auctions) is based on a model of one-core-per-parachain: this is a legacy interpretation of the Polkadot platform and is not a reflection of its present capabilities. With Polkadot's capability to adapt to its users'need, a new paradign for allocating coretime is being implemented by ecosystem teams. Coretime on the Polkadot UC is envisioned to be sold by the Polkadot System in two separate formats: Bulk Coretime and Instantaneous Coretime. When a Polkadot Core is utilized, we say it is dedicated to a \"Task\" rather than a \"parachain\". The Task to which a Core is dedicated may change at every Relay-chain block and while one predominant type of Task is to secure a Cumulus-based blockchain (i.e. a parachain), other types of Tasks are envisioned. Bulk Coretime is sold periodically on a specialised system chain known as the \"Coretime-chain\" and allocated in advance of its usage, whereas Instantaneous Coretime is sold on the Relay-chain immediately prior to usage on a block-by-block basis.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to explain this paradigm change within the Polkadot community to adapt to end-user needs, provide more agility and reduce long-term design flows.","start":"2023-09-15T14:30:00+02:00","end":"2023-09-15T15:20:00+02:00","stageId":"magazin__main_stage","speakers":[{"id":"gavin_wood","name":"Gavin Wood","bio":"-","eventId":"protocol_berg","photo":"https://speak.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/gavin_aT6VA0l.jpeg"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"protocol_berg","coverImage":"/sessions/protocol_berg/agile_coretime_a_periodic_salebased_method_for_assigning_polkadot_coretime.jpg"}
