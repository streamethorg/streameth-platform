  "description": "In this presentation, I'll go over the state of decentralized and shared sequencers for rollups, as well as existing and potential architectures for them. Decentralizing sequencers is needed for rollups to have true decentralization and censorship resistance, and sharing sequencers between rollups opens up the possibility of cross-rollup composability.",
