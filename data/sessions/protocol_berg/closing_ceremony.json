    "description": "In this session, we invite you to grab a closing drink and wrap up the day with us! Learn more about the motivation behind Protocol Berg: What led us to organize this event and why did we decide to set it up as a donation-backed, sponsorless, non-profit event that is free to attend?\r\n\r\nWe will share our thoughts on event content curation, sponsors, and ecosystem collaboration. We will create transparency over our expenditures and how this event was financed.\r\n\r\nWe will also touch on the hardships and experiences of organizing a donation-only event, purely brought to you by a group of volunteers, always keeping in mind our goal: putting the attendee experience and content quality first.",
