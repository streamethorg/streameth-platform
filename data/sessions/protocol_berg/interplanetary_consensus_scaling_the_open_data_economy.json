  "description": "Consensus poses a major scalability bottleneck in blockchain networks - hampering web-scale applications like Twitch, Twitter, Tiktok, or web3 alternatives to scale within web3. Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) is a new framework to enable on-demand horizontal scalability of Filecoin to meet web-scale application demands - unlocking an open data economy of composable subnets for scalable computation, fast data retrievals, application-specific gaming networks, and more on the Filecoin network.",
