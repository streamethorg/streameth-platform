{"id":"recursive_snarks_for_efficiency_scalability_and_privacy","name":"Recursive SNARKs for Efficiency, Scalability, and Privacy","description":"Blockchains, with their primary focus on decentralization, open participation, and resilience, inherently lack efficiency, scalability, and privacy. Similar to parallel computing algorithms, the scalability of a blockchain-based system depends on the extent to which computational tasks can be moved off-chain. Zero knowledge techniques, such as recursive SNARKs, offer an effective means of shifting computation off-chain, requiring only proof verification as part of the consensus process. Mina demonstrates the use of these techniques in its consensus algorithm Ouroboros Samasika and zkApps. Privacy poses a challenge in blockchain systems due to their open public ledgers. However, zero knowledge proofs enable reduced data exposure on the public ledger and allow fine-tuning of the level of disclosure. Etonec's payment system serves as an exemplary application showcasing enhanced privacy in blockchains.","start":1694784600000,"end":1694786100000,"stageId":"atelier__side_stage","speakers":[{"id":"philipp_kant","name":"Philipp Kant","bio":"Philipp Kant is the Engineering Manager at Mina Foundation, the public benefit corporation serving the Mina Protocol.
