If you have a multi-billion dollar protocol, it's a good idea to back it up.\r\n\r\nI will briefly introduce Arweave as the permanent data storage layer of choice for many networks, and dive into the use case of Kyve.network, and how it is useful and prudent to store any other network's chainstate history in this way - particularly if a subject network discards data (as Ethereum is considering) this becomes important for historical and even accounting purposes.","start":"2023-09-15T10:30:00.000Z","end":"2023-09-15T10:55:00.000Z","stageId":"atelier__side_stage","speakers":[{"id":"garrett_macdonald","name":"Garrett MacDonald","bio":"Long time contributor to the decentralized revolution.
