At the age of 15, I heard that ordinary people can actually program computers, I bought a 1200 page book about C++ and started learning. I sticked with C++ for quite a while, learned Java, went back to C++, learned D, Python, Haskell and eventually Rust. Then I became interested in peer-to-peer systems, experimented with rust-libp2p and found that blockchains could play a major role in mitigating shortcomings of p2p systems. So it happened that I applied at Parity Technologies as a core developer. At Parity Technologies I am driving and implementing major parts of Polkadot's Parachain consensus.","eventId":"protocol_berg","photo":"https://speak.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/eskimor_U4xtWaX.png"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"protocol_berg","coverImage":"/sessions/protocol_berg/parachain_consensus_from_the_ground_up.jpg"}
