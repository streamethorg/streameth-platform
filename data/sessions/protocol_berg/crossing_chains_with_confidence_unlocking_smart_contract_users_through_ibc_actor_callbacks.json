Actor callbacks provide a standardized interface that allows smart contracts to confirm the occurrence of a cross-chain actions. We will delve into the practical implications of this extension, showcasing how it enhances the workflows of inter-chain transactions. With actor callbacks, it is possible to transfer tokens and perform an action with the tokens combining the utility of transfer and general message passing across chains.","start":"2023-09-15T13:00:00+02:00","end":"2023-09-15T13:25:00+02:00","stageId":"magazin__main_stage","speakers":[{"id":"susannah_evans","name":"Susannah Evans","bio":"Susannah is the product lead for the IBC team at Interchain","eventId":"protocol_berg","photo":"https://speak.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/SUSE_THE_BAD_KID_sNQMfmx.jpeg"},{"id":"charleen_fei","name":"Charleen Fei","bio":"-","eventId":"protocol_berg","photo":"https://speak.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/charly_zYfKdpD.jpeg"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"protocol_berg","coverImage":"/sessions/protocol_berg/crossing_chains_with_confidence_unlocking_smart_contract_users_through_ibc_actor_callbacks.jpg"}
