The idea of the Overton window is introduced, which suggests that political debates often occur within a narrow window of ideas, and creating a new country could allow for more radical ideas to be explored. The importance of having a manifesto and codified values is emphasized, but also the need to bridge the gap between idealism and practicality. The video also touches on the potential for creating aristocratic societies and the importance of creating a meritocracy. Finally, the concept of responsibilities and adding value to a new country is discussed.","start":"2023-04-10T08:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-04-10T08:30:00.000Z","stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"tomiowa","name":"Tomiowa","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__jurisdictions_for_longevity"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/555fcx57ugy1m73p/index.m3u8","playbackId":"555fcx57ugy1m73p","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023__jurisdictions_for_longevity","coverImage":"/sessions/zuzalu_montenegro_2023__jurisdictions_for_longevity/how_to_start_a_country.jpg"}
