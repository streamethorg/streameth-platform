    "description": "In this video, Lawrence Lyon talks about the importance of fighting aging and extending healthy lifespan. He discusses Vida del, a decentralized organization that funds aging research and accelerates drug development for the longevity biotech field. Lyon argues that the current paradigm of managing symptoms and keeping people in poor health for longer is unsustainable and economically unsustainable. He proposes a new paradigm for medicine that targets the root cause of chronic disease. Lyon also discusses different approaches to fighting aging, including the damage repair approach, cellular partial reprogramming approach, and tissue replacement approach. He argues that having a highly-aligned community with a scalable model, such as a Dow like Vida Dow, is the best bet for fighting aging.",
