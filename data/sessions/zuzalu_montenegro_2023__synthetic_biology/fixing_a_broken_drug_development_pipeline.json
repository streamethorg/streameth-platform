  "description": "In this video, Luke Taii, CEO and co-founder of Vibe Bio, discusses his personal experience with the broken drug pipeline and how his company is working to fix it. He explains that the challenge is not finding potential treatments, but funding them, and that inflection points are often the pinch point where companies lack the capital to pursue their high potential medicines. Taii draws inspiration from communities of patients and scientists who have successfully developed transformative medicines through philanthropic funding and advocacy. He believes that decentralized science, using a DAO, can extend this approach to the 13,000+ diseases out there, and that inflection point financing can help companies reach pivotal studies and unlock larger portions of value. Taii emphasizes the importance of software in analyzing and prioritizing diseases, and the power of communities, technology, and capital to unlock a big impact for good.",
