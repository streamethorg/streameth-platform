{"id":"mopro_clientside_proving_on_mobile_made_easy","name":"mopro: Client-side proving on mobile made easy","description":"We want to be able to do client-side proofs on mobile natively. Currently, this isn't straightforward to do. This leads to a suboptimal user-experience when end-users want to prove statements from a mobile environment. We also want to make it easy for developers to write circuits that can be run from a phone. Finally, a lot of client-size proofs we want to make, like ECDSA signatures, are quite expensive to run. Running in a native environment with access to things like GPU, we can expect to improve this.\n\nIn this talk we will talk about mopro, a new library that attempts to address these problems to make native mobile proving easier and faster. We'll look at Zupass as a motivating case study and go through current status, challenges, future work and how you can contribute.","start":1700137800000,"end":1700139600000,"stageId":"dolmabahce_b__c","speakers":[{"id":"oskar_thorn","name":"Oskar Thorén","bio":"Oskar Thorén is an independent researcher, writing and researching about Zero Knowledge Proofs.
