    "description": "Identity verification is a common application in daily life, but digital identity systems that prioritize privacy through cryptography are less common. In this talk, I will share a real-world identity verification project that integrates with an official APIs from the Taiwanese government. The project uses the Semaphore framework for zero-knowledge proofs to protect private data, and it also complies with the standards set by W3C for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).",
