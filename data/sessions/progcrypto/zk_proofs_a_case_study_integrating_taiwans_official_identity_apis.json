In this talk, I will share a real-world identity verification project that integrates with an official APIs from the Taiwanese government. The project uses the Semaphore framework for zero-knowledge proofs to protect private data, and it also complies with the standards set by W3C for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).","start":1700132820000,"end":1700133720000,"stageId":"marmara","speakers":[{"id":"yuren_ju","name":"Yuren Ju","bio":"As a passionate software developer, exploring new advancements in the field has always been a focus.
