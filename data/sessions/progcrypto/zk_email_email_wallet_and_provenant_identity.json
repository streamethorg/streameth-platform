  "description": "We announce an email-based account abstraction wallet, allowing users to\n send tokens simply by sending emails, without any actions from \nrecipients. By trusting only the original email server (i.e. gmail) and \nnot a centralized attester, users can ensure the assets in their wallet \nare secure and available. We describe a simple extension framework that \nlets any developer add arbitrary smart contract calls via emails. In \naddition to the wallet, we describe a more generic proof of email sdk \nthat lets anyone verify identities directly from web2 without \ncentralized attesters, via proofs of user's emails.",

They allow smart contracts\n to securely import more kinds of off-chain data that users usually send\n and receive. I also research privacy-preserving smart contracts, \nespecially smart contract obfuscation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcra.2022.100118).",
