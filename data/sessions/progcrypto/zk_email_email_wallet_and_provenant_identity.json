    "description": "We announce an email-based account abstraction wallet, allowing users to\n send tokens simply by sending emails, without any actions from \nrecipients. By trusting only the original email server (i.e. gmail) and \nnot a centralized attester, users can ensure the assets in their wallet \nare secure and available. We describe a simple extension framework that \nlets any developer add arbitrary smart contract calls via emails. In \naddition to the wallet, we describe a more generic proof of email sdk \nthat lets anyone verify identities directly from web2 without \ncentralized attesters, via proofs of user's emails.",
