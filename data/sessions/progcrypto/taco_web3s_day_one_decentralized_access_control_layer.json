{"id":"taco_web3s_day_one_decentralized_access_control_layer","name":"TACo: Web3's Day One Decentralized Access Control Layer ","description":"Part 1 | Integrating Decentralized Access Control into your Web3 application\n| Hands-on Coding Session | 30 mins\n\nThe first part will introduce attendees to TACo, a plug-in access control layer & network relevant to virtually every Web3 app/stack/project that handles private data. Early adopters are building  in domains where compromising on trust minimization simply doesn’t work for the core value proposition; recovering seed phrases, passing on crypto assets as inheritance, enforcing decryption rights for tokenized legacy media libraries, transferring sensitive model I/O to remote machines, & concealing in-game assets.\n\nWe will walk through TACo's TypeScript & Python APIs, public key generation via DKG rituals, specifying/combining/embedding access conditions, node cohort creation and sponsorship, plus other key concepts – all in an interactive session using the hacker-friendly Tapir testnet. \n\nPart 2 | Day One Decentralization & Trust Burden Transparency | Whiteboarding & Discussion | 30 mins \n\nWeb3's reputation is in a fragile state – there's never been a worse time for decentralization cosplay. Using the Threshold network and our just-released programmable access control service (TACo) as a case study, this part will explain why i. Day One Decentralization and ii. Trust Burden Transparency are such vital principles for Web3 going forward. \n\nWe will discuss a list of mission-critical questions to ask Web3 providers – that among other things, pertain to the independence of the node array running their software, the disproportionate power of the DAO and other entities, how open source the user/node-facing clients are, and SPOFs in the undergirding infrastructure (e.g. what could a malicious Infura do?).
