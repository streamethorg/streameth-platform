  "description": "One of the more recent folding schemes, Protostar, has an unusual property - the arithmetization used in it is neither plonkish, nor R1CS, nor CCS. In fact, it is \"generic\" - i.e., constraint system is just a collection of algebraic equations of arbitrary form.\n\nMoreover, it is expected that significant performance gains can be obtained by using equations of relatively high degree.\n\nIn this talk, I will present my circuit builder for generic arithmetization, which I have used to implement Protostar, demonstrate how to use it, and talk about some tricks with high-degree polynomias allowing to drop the witness size significantly.\n\nPrerequisites: practically, you do not need to understand details about folding to write circuits in generic arithmetization; however, it will surely help in some parts of the talk.",

I'm mainly interested in anything privacy-related, and especially efficient and lightweight zero knowledge proofs.\n\nMy current focus of research is folding schemes, which, I hope, some day, will enable us to prove a lot of elaborate things client-side - like zk-poex or proofs of execution of various distributed protocols.",
