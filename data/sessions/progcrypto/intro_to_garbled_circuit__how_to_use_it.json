  "description": "In the first half, we present a basic idea of how garbled circuit (GC) works and also present how arithmetic circuit works together with GC.  In the second half, we'll give a hands-on coding to show how to use general-purpose garbled circuit framework called mpz by building a simple MPC circuit and demonstrating it.",
