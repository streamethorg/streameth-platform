In the second half, we'll give a hands-on coding to show how to use general-purpose garbled circuit framework called mpz by building a simple MPC circuit and demonstrating it.","start":1700211600000,"end":1700215200000,"stageId":"dolmabahce_a","speakers":[{"id":"nam_ngo","name":"Nam Ngo","bio":"MPC Research at PSE/EF","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lfOl-U3r3IfJttvS4z44gqDR755vgyAm/view"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"progcrypto","track":"Next Gen Applied Crypto","coverImage":"/sessions/progcrypto/intro_to_garbled_circuit__how_to_use_it.jpg"}
