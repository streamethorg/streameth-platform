In the second half, we'll give a hands-on coding to show how to use general-purpose garbled circuit framework called mpz by building a simple MPC circuit and demonstrating it.","start":1700211600000,"end":1700215200000,"stageId":"dolmabahce_a","speakers":[{"id":"takamichi_tsutsumi","name":"Takamichi Tsutsumi","bio":"Software Engineer at PSE.
