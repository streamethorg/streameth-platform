We will demo our new Javascript web interface allowing any developer to deploy a ZK-powered application with Axiom by simply adding a callback to their smart contract and give examples of new applications it enables.  Finally, we discuss the foundational ZK building blocks enabling this developer experience, including our halo2-lib circuit framework, universal SNARK aggregator, client side WASM prover, and cross-circuit lookup system.\n\n(Please let us know if this description will be posted publicly, as it references several features we would prefer not to publicly announce until later.)","start":1700139600000,"end":1700141400000,"stageId":"marmara","speakers":[{"id":"yi_sun","name":"Yi Sun","bio":"Yi Sun is a co-founder of Axiom, which scales data-rich applications on Ethereum by providing access to more data and more compute via ZK.
