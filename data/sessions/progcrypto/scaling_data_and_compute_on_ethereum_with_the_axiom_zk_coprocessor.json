    "description": "We will present Axiom V2, which gives smart contracts trustless access to the entire history of Ethereum and custom verified compute over it.  We will demo our new Javascript web interface allowing any developer to deploy a ZK-powered application with Axiom by simply adding a callback to their smart contract and give examples of new applications it enables.  Finally, we discuss the foundational ZK building blocks enabling this developer experience, including our halo2-lib circuit framework, universal SNARK aggregator, client side WASM prover, and cross-circuit lookup system.",
