    "description": "This talk covers recent work on a new approach to private voting with minimal off-chain dependencies. The novelty of our approach lies in our use of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for verifying voter eligibility while preserving anonymity, as well as the use of a timelock service to ensure privacy of votes for the duration of the voting period. It is hoped that the audience will gain an appreciation for the power of recent advances in ZK proof systems that make such solutions more practical.",
