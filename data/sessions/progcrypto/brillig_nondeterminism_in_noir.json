{"id":"brillig_nondeterminism_in_noir","name":"Brillig: Nondeterminism in Noir","description":"Practical ZK applications will always require the ability to execute code outside of the circuit environment. Noir now supports this functionality through its intermediate representation (ACIR) with the introduction of a new opcode, enabling developers to build more powerful applications. This new opcode itself contains code called Brillig Intermediate Representation which is executed by a new unconstrained finite field virtual machine, the Brillig VM.","start":1700217000000,"end":1700218800000,"stageId":"marmara","speakers":[{"id":"maxim_vezenov","name":"Maxim Vezenov","bio":"Consumed with ZK and bringing about the widespread adoption of this revolutionary technology.
