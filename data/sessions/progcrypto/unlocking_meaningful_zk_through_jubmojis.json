    "description": "This talk will be a consumer-app focused overview of ZK technologies, carefully analyzing its affordances in the real world and how we can unlock its full potential. We will then look at these affordances through the lens of Jubmojis, a project that uses NFC cards to give people ZK-friendly data related to in-person interactions.",
