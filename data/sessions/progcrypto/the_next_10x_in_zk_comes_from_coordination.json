Fortunately, zkSNARKs and related technologies have become increasingly powerful, allowing for blockchains to tap into limitless compute and privacy.\n\nThe ZK landscape is characterized by fast-moving research and open-source implementations. We believe that a critical missing piece in the ZK ecosystem is a coordination layer to allow for all actors in the ZK supply chain to coordinate and increase adoption of ZK across blockchain ecosystems.","start":1700210100000,"end":1700211900000,"stageId":"marmara","speakers":[{"id":"uma_roy","name":"Uma Roy","bio":"Uma is a cofounder of Succinct, which is focused on empowering developers to use zero-knowledge proofs in making the next-generation of blockchain applications.","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mNW7vm76yDsA3f-Qk5YiVQTa5nKgp6Or"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"progcrypto","coverImage":"/sessions/progcrypto/the_next_10x_in_zk_comes_from_coordination.jpg"}
