Throughout the talk FHE is used in abstract sense, so no in-depth knowledge of FHE, other than its definition, is required!","start":1700208900000,"end":1700209800000,"stageId":"dolmabahce_b__c","speakers":[{"id":"janmajaya_mall","name":"Janmajaya Mall","bio":"I am currently very excited about new type of applications FHE can enable for blockchains. For ex, using FHE we can develop applications like Oblivious message retrieval, Private Information retrieval / set intersection to immensely improve user experience of  privacy preserving protocols. Moreover, with threshold FHE we can have encrypted shared state on-chain, allowing us to build private applications that simply were not possible before.  \n\nBefore jumping to FHE, I worked on writing aggregation circuits, dev tools for zk and coco (crypto based social media moderation tool) at PSE.
