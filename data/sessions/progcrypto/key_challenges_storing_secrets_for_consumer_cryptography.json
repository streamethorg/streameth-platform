    "description": "If programmable cryptography is a way to turn real world problems of trust \nand coordination into problems of key management, how can we tackle the \n problem of storing cryptographic secrets in a secure and accessible way\n for broad audiences? We\u2019ll talk about our thoughts on key management for Daimo, a stablecoin \npayments app on Ethereum we\u2019re building, and how Device Keys and \nPasskeys can enable secure and friendly self-custody wallets with \nAccount Abstraction and P256 signature verification on-chain.",
