  "description": "Lookup arguments are an extremely powerful primitive for constructing performant SNARKs. They allow a prover to efficiently prove that a value belongs to some table. Recent work beginning with Caulk and continuing through cq make the prover time independent of the table size, which allows using very large tables. We will discuss the history of lookups and how they work, with particular focus on log derivative lookups. These include cq, for large tables, and the lookup of ProtoStar, which supports folding. ",

I am a cofounder of Zeta Function Technologies, where my cofounder Ariel Gabizon and I research and develop new protocols for SNARKs. We co-authored cq with Dario Fiore, a lookup argument for large tables, and ProtoGalaxy, an extension of ProtoStar to efficiently fold multiple instances.",
