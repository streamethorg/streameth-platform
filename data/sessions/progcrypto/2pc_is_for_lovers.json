  "description": "ZK is good at keeping secrets, but has some limitations when it comes to making connections. MPC (multi-party computation) can perform computations on shared secrets and reveal results only under the right conditions, whether it's a secret you only want to reveal if the other person feels the same or finding correlations in medical data without trusting a single party with all your information. Barry will show how MPC can help solve problems that ZK can't, using some very human  examples - starting with two friends who are secretly in love with each other.",
