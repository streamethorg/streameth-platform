{"id":"sirius_an_opensource_generic_circuit_folding_framework","name":"Sirius: An Open-Source Generic Circuit Folding Framework","description":"In this talk, we will unveil project Sirius, an open-source framework for generic circuit folding. Inspired by Protostar, Sirius offers constraint system agnostic folding capabilities, which enables the seamless folding of circuits described in various constraint systems, including but not limited to Plonk, R1CS and the integration of the lookup argument.\n","start":1700223300000,"end":1700225100000,"stageId":"marmara","speakers":[{"id":"chao_ma","name":"Chao Ma","bio":"Dr. Chao Ma is the co-founder at Snarkify, an ZK infra startup delicated to scaling ZKP for trustless computing.
