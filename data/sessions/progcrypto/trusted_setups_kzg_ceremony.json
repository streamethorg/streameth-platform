{"id":"trusted_setups_kzg_ceremony","name":"Trusted Setups: KZG Ceremony","description":"I am a web3 developer who worked on the KZG Ceremony without strong knowledge on ZK and polynomial commitments. At first it looked like moon math but with the practical experience I learned an intuitive way to understand Protodanksharding and KZG as a developer (not mathematician nor cryptographer).\n\nI feel this thinking process is worth sharing to developers and builders who want to understand the Protodanksharding scaling strategy with ZK and the importance of a trusted setup (ceremony).  This talk would aim to newcomers web3 developers that still view the ZK area as moon math and are particularly interested on why trusted setups are important.","start":1700142300000,"end":1700143200000,"stageId":"dolmabahce_b__c","speakers":[{"id":"nico_serrano","name":"Nico Serrano","bio":"I am a software developer that believes trustless applications are a great way to balance power and fairness in our actual systems. I'm currently working on the Privacy & Scaling Explorations team at the Ethereum Foundation on different projects focused on trusted setups and state channels. \n\nWhile being part of the team that build the KZG Ceremony I learned a lot about the \"moon math\" behind trusted setups that sometimes scares developers into delving to the ZK world. I feel that my experience as a developer/builder might help you out understand a bit more about trusted setups/ceremonies and the ZK landscape.","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcWUwKF8DQws8VpD3DOsuRaGcY_yahJW/view"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"progcrypto","coverImage":"/sessions/progcrypto/trusted_setups_kzg_ceremony.jpg"}
