    "description": "I am a web3 developer who worked on the KZG Ceremony without strong knowledge on ZK and polynomial commitments. At first it looked like moon math but with the practical experience I learned an intuitive way to understand Protodanksharding and KZG as a developer (not mathematician nor cryptographer).\n\nI feel this thinking process is worth sharing to developers and builders who want to understand the Protodanksharding scaling strategy with ZK and the importance of a trusted setup (ceremony).  This talk would aim to newcomers web3 developers that still view the ZK area as moon math and are particularly interested on why trusted setups are important.",

I'm currently working on the Privacy & Scaling Explorations team at the Ethereum Foundation on different projects focused on trusted setups and state channels. \n\nWhile being part of the team that build the KZG Ceremony I learned a lot about the \"moon math\" behind trusted setups that sometimes scares developers into delving to the ZK world. I feel that my experience as a developer/builder might help you out understand a bit more about trusted setups/ceremonies and the ZK landscape.",
