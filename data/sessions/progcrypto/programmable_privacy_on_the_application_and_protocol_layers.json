  "description": "Programmable privacy has recently come into focus as a way to empower users in the context of MEV. Privacy-centric projects, such as Penumbra and Aztec, have been exploring programmable privacy from a different lens. What classes of applications need programmable privacy, and what are the best practices in designing them? What are the minimal cryptographic features that a protocol must have to support a private application?",
