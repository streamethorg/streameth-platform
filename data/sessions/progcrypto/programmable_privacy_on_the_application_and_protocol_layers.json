{"id":"programmable_privacy_on_the_application_and_protocol_layers","name":"Programmable Privacy on the Application and Protocol Layers","description":"Programmable privacy has recently come into focus as a way to empower users in the context of MEV. Privacy-centric projects, such as Penumbra and Aztec, have been exploring programmable privacy from a different lens. What classes of applications need programmable privacy, and what are the best practices in designing them? What are the minimal cryptographic features that a protocol must have to support a private application?","start":1700204400000,"end":1700206200000,"stageId":"auditorium","speakers":[{"id":"ying_tong","name":"Ying Tong","bio":"Ying Tong is an applied cryptographer at Geometry Research and a maintainer of the halo2 library.
