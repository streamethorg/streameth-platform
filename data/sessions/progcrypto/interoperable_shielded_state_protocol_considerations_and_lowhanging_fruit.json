{"id":"interoperable_shielded_state_protocol_considerations_and_lowhanging_fruit","name":"Interoperable shielded state: protocol considerations and low-hanging fruit","description":"Shielded state is fragmented. Data from multiple users cannot interact, i.e. be used together as inputs and outputs for a verifiable function. This is limiting. We discuss a number of interesting applications- games, exchanges, social networks, and more- that can immediately be built once interactive shielding is unblocked. The session will also touch on why unblocking is difficult, including why approaches based on pure zero knowledge or fully homomorphic encryption are insufficient. It will then go over a practical implementation, along with a roadmap for full decentralization.
