This presentation describes how to assemble the latest research to build a practical foldable Plonk-ish SNARK with a linear-time Prover, fully succinct Verifier. At each fold the Prover only commits to structured witness statements, without the grand product polynomials associated with Plonk","start":1700213400000,"end":1700215200000,"stageId":"auditorium","speakers":[{"id":"zac","name":"Zac","bio":"Coming soon","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jLrW54QNuyqdF2waaScfRhLN9rQacN7t"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"progcrypto","coverImage":"/sessions/progcrypto/how_to_build_a_modern_snark.jpg"}
