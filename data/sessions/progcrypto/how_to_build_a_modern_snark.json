This presentation describes how to assemble the latest research to build a practical foldable Plonk-ish SNARK with a linear-time Prover, fully succinct Verifier. At each fold the Prover only commits to structured witness statements, without the grand product polynomials associated with Plonk","start":1700206200000,"end":1700208000000,"stageId":"auditorium","speakers":[{"id":"zac","name":"Zac","bio":"CEO Aztec.
