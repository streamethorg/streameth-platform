  "description": "NFC chips offer a unique, largely unexplored modality when paired with zero knowledge cryptography. The physical proximity constraints of NFC paired with secure element technology enable it to be a source of meaningful, qualitative human attestations. This makes it possible to take arbitrary interactions in the physical world and translate them into the world of bits. On the other hand, ZK offers the unique benefit of programmable verifiability - claims produced by NFC chips can be verified succinctly in a cross-platform, privacy preserving manner. We'll explore how we integrated these two technologies in order to build Jubmojis, and dive into many of the unexplored directions for future research!",
