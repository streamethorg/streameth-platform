{"id":"towards_tor_based_validator_privacy","name":"Towards Tor based Validator Privacy","description":"The need of privacy for validators in Ethereum network is becoming increasingly important. An attacker's motivation could be to reveal the true identity of a validator or to disrupt validator's duty in the next slot with DoS attacks. If successful, this can result in delayed block production that can affect the finality of the transactions in the chain or lead to loss of potential gains as per MEV strategy.\n\n.At the network layer level, one could harden the privacy of the validator by unlinking its physical IP address from its produced messages like attestations and blocks. This unlinkability would complicate adversary's analysis and reduce the chance of a successful attack against validators.\n This talk presents ongoing work on using independent anonymous communication protocol TOR for network level privacy of Validator activities like producing attestations/blocks. We demonstrate the integration of TOR with the nimbus client for ethereum beacon chain, share some of the design challenges, measure the latency of a successfully running instance of tor-based validators in the georli network","start":1700206500000,"end":1700208300000,"stageId":"marmara","speakers":[{"id":"ujscale","name":"ujscale","bio":"Working in validator privacy, certificate security, static analysis.
