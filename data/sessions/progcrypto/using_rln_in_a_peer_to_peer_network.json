  "description": "We will discuss how Rate Limiting Nullifiers (RLN) can be used in a peer-to-peer network, like Waku, to form the backbone of spam prevention in a trustless environment. This topic should be particularly interesting since there is a ton of discussion about decentralized messaging, and a topic that does not get covered the most is spam prevention. Most protocols make use of an underlying blockchain to mitigate spam, but then messaging is directly linked to the throughput of that chain. There is a way to combine the security of a blockchain, and leverage off-chain messaging to truly build a messaging system that protects its relayers.\nI hope the audience understands the need for RLN in this context, and can start using waku-rln-relay for their messaging needs.",

This allows spam prevention at the messaging infrastructure layer. We work closely with pse engineers to iterate on the product. privacy maxi.\nIn my free time, catch me by the pool or kayaking!",
