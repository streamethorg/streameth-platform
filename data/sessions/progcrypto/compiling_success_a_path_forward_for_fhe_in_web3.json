Why is that? \n\nWe’ll take a look at what needs to happen to make fully homomorphic encryption usable for real world web3 applications. We’ll address technical challenges on the implementation and integration front, concluding with if and how building a compiler can solve many of the present day issues of fully homomorphic encryption.","start":1700213400000,"end":1700214300000,"stageId":"dolmabahce_b__c","speakers":[{"id":"rick_weber","name":"Rick Weber","bio":"Rick is an engineer at Sunscreen where he works on making both FHE and \nZKPs easy for engineers to use.
