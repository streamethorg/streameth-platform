My research responsibilities include participating in the design and implementation of the chunk prover with PSE, exploring backward-compatible folding options, and considering alternatives to Halo2's lookup. Planning-wise, I work on integrating our strategies with a multi-proofs architecture for L2 proving and managing engineering resources to meet our objectives.\n\nFor my talk, I'll address the chunk prover design by the PSE and our implementation details & challenges. Also some thoughts on how to retrofit latest research results to the existing complex codebase.\n","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11-VMlbalnHM4KWWuprsIRjTCev4tuUhe/view"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"progcrypto","coverImage":"/sessions/progcrypto/chunk_prover.jpg"}
