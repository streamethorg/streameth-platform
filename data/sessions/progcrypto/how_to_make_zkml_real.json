    "description": "ZKML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning) is not real... yet, according to this article (https://medium.com/@ModulusLabs/chapter-8-make-zkml-real-a3a355b2b756) by Modulus Labs. In this talk, we'll explore the current state of ZKML and the challenges hindering its realization. We will delve into the potential solutions to make ZKML a reality, drawing insights from Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and optimistic systems, among other approaches.",
