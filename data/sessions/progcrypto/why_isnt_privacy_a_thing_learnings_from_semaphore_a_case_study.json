Learnings from Semaphore: A case study","description":"In this talk, I'll delve into an examination of Semaphore, a widely acknowledged yet underexploited Zero-Knowledge (ZK) primitive, through the eyes of the builders leveraging it and potential users. \"Privacy is a fundamental right,\" yet there is a chasm between the recognized potential and actual utilization of privacy technologies like Semaphore in real-world applications. This session aims to foster a deep, collective reflection on the barriers, breakthroughs, and uncharted pathways in Semaphoreâ€™s journey, and by extension, the trajectory of privacy technologies at large. This talk will leverage the results of the User Research I conducted for the Semaphore team, and present its outcomes and how others in the ZK and Privacy can benefit from its findings.
