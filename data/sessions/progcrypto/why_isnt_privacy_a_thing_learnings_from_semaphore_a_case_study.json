  "name": "Why isn't privacy a \"thing\"? Learnings from Semaphore: A case study",
  "description": "In this talk, I'll delve into an examination of Semaphore, a widely acknowledged yet underexploited Zero-Knowledge (ZK) primitive, through the eyes of the builders leveraging it and potential users. \"Privacy is a fundamental right,\" yet there is a chasm between the recognized potential and actual utilization of privacy technologies like Semaphore in real-world applications. This session aims to foster a deep, collective reflection on the barriers, breakthroughs, and uncharted pathways in Semaphore\u2019s journey, and by extension, the trajectory of privacy technologies at large. This talk will leverage the results of the User Research I conducted for the Semaphore team, and present its outcomes and how others in the ZK and Privacy can benefit from its findings. ",
