{"id":"demystifying_fhe","name":"Demystifying FHE","description":"The workshop will mainly focus on basic theory behind fully homomorphic encryption schemes based on RLWE. How to reason about different schemes. How to think about communication and performance trade offs when working with FHE. Describes different FHE operations and how to build applications using FHE. Moreover, I will try to conclude the presentation by live coding a simple FHE circuit with the audience.

For ex, using FHE we can develop applications like Oblivious message retrieval, Private Information retrieval / set intersection to immensely improve user experience of  privacy preserving protocols. Moreover, with threshold FHE we can have encrypted shared state on-chain, allowing us to build private applications that simply were not possible before.  \n\nBefore jumping to FHE, I worked on writing aggregation circuits, dev tools for zk and coco (crypto based social media moderation tool) at PSE.
