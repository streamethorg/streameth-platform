  "description": "The first part of the hack-your-own-genome workshop explains:\n* How and where can I sequence your genome?\n* How do health and longevity are connected with genetics? Which longevity genes do I have?\n* How can I analyze my or somebodies genome with open-source tools and libraries?\n* When I see an exciting gene or gene variant, how can I check it in my genome and interpret my genotype?\n* Most of the traits are polygenic. How can I evaluate my polygenic risk scores\n* Which types of genomic apps exist?\nThe talk will heavily utilize http://dna-seq.github.io/ open-source tools and apps that we develop.",
