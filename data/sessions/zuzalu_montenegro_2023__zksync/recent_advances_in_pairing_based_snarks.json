  "description": "In this video, the speaker provides an overview of the last decade of pairing-based snarks, focusing on the third chapter of this approach. They discuss the KZG polynomial commitment scheme and how it can be used to prove that a polynomial is equal to the vanishing polynomial of a subset of T in only O(S) operations. The speaker introduces the concept of fractional decomposition and explains how it can be used to compute the commitment to ZT minus S, which is a sparse combination of commitments that can be pre-computed.",
