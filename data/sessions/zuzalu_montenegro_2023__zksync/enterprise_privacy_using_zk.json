  "description": "In this video, Paul Bernand, the global blockchain leader at EY, discusses enterprise privacy in the CK field. He explains that most enterprise deals require a different kind of privacy than what most individual users need and that private blockchains don't work. Bernand introduces Nightfall, a layer to ZK-Optimistic Privacy Rollup that EY has been working on since 2017. He explains that Nightfall is a shield contract that requires an enterprise identity certificate to use and is confidential but not anonymous. Bernand also discusses the cost of transactions and the development process of Nightfall.",
