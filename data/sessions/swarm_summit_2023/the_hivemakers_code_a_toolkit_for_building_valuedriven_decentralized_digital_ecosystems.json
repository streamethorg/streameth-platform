  "description": "When you can\u2019t control what your system is used for, your options for maximizing its positive impact are limited. You have to start by creating the right set of values and working to align the ecosystem\u2019s participants around them. You must enable its positive uses and engage people to develop an intrinsic motivation to do good. By releasing this document, we want to start a movement. One that will attract those of you who want to build decentralized ecosystems consciously and gradually change how the scene looks. So that purposeful technology will soon help people regain sovereignty over their data, identities, and lives.",
