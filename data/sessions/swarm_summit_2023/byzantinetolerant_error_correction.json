            "bio": "Silur started his career as a pentester and hacker at a really young age, with a great affinity to cryptography and higher mathematics. Having a good prior understanding in cryptocurrencies when the industry boomed in 2016, he gained an advantage as an early industry specialist, doing work for the Ethereum foundation until 2018. In 2019 he designed a cipher that entered the NIST Lightweight Encryption Standard competition. Consequently, he proved himself in designing and implementing blockchains from scratch as the co-founder of QANPlatform and as an early partner of CasperLabs. Having built dozens of dApps, protocols and full chains from both mass-market and government clients, Silur is also a co-organizer of the largest Capture the flag event on the planet, in which he challenges the best hackers in the world to break blockchain systems and reproduce historical cryptocurrency hacks. Silur is also a member of the Wigner's research centre of physics where he specializes on quantum computation and post-quantum cryptography. He took a place on the Forbes 30 under 30 list for his achievments in cybersecurity and web3.",
