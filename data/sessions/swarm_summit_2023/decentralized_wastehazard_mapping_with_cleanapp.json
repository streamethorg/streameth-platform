{"id":"decentralized_wastehazard_mapping_with_cleanapp","name":"Decentralized Waste/Hazard Mapping with CleanApp","description":"CleanApp is a global coordination game for waste/hazard mapping. Our protocol rewards players for uploading reports of waste and hazards (launching September, with much more functionality soon). At first glance, these types of images may not seem very valuable or especially sensitive. Why do they need to be stored on a secure dCloud like EthSwarm? There are many reasons our hotspot data requires the highest security and data availability guarantees. One of the strongest is that waste/hazard maps are actually global liability maps, which polluters work hard to keep out of public view. Together, weâ€™re changing that dynamic.","start":"2023-06-21T14:15:00.000Z","end":"2023-06-21T14:25:00.000Z","stageId":"main","speakers":[{"id":"boris_mamlyuk","name":"Boris Mamlyuk","bio":"CleanApp","eventId":"swarm_summit_2023","photo":"https://summit.ethswarm.org/media/avatars/photo_2023-06-21_10.11.25_LKZXvba.jpeg"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/5f26z058s1w4knct/index.m3u8","playbackId":"5f26z058s1w4knct","eventId":"swarm_summit_2023"}
