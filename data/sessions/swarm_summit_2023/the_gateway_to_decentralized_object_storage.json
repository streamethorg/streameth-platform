    "description": "There are currently over 800,000 users of Amazon\u2019s S3 enterprise object storage solution. This represents roughly a 93% market share in a $4.83 billion dollar market, with a compound annual growth of 13.6%. Cloud storage is a core service enabling almost every technology we utilize today in our personal and business lives. It may be the gateway for the masses to the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Decentralized storage has already been praised in the U.S. Congress by Sen. Pat Toomey for protecting the free press in China. In order to encourage more users to adopt decentralized storage, we need to eliminate key friction points from the onboarding and migration process.",
