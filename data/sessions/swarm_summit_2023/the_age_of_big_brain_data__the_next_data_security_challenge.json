    "description": "Neuroscience has been very busy creating newer, faster, and less invasive ways of collecting vast amounts of brain data. This data has helped us diagnose many diseases, accelerated research on finding new medical treatments, and is helping to explain the inner workings of our mind. But collecting highly person-specific biological data comes with many challenges. We will explore how the advent of modern neuroscience and the huge amounts of data it collects, will likely impact our lives and the lives of our digital selves.",
