{"id":"ercx_fast_checking_of_erc_standards_and_beyond","name":"ERCx, Fast Checking of ERC standards and Beyond","description":"We will need standard equipment for a talk. If tables are present in the room, we may have a hands-on moment where attendees can experiment with the tool.\r\n\r\nYlies Falcone will run the session.\r\n\r\nERCx (https://ercx.runtimeverification.com) is a tool suite that helps assess the behavior of smart contracts. ERCx checks the conformance of a contract to ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) standards as well as additional desirable security properties. ERCx aims to help the Ethereum community by providing (i) contract developers with pre-deployment conformance and property checks and (ii) token investors with easy-to-run and fast quality assessment.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we show developers how ERCx works and how they can use it to create new tokens conformant with existing standards. Avoid repeating past mistakes and add an extra security layer when it comes to avoiding potential future exploits. We will also overview the design choices and the future of ERCx.","start":"2023-09-16T11:30:00-05:00","end":"2023-09-16T12:00:00-05:00","stageId":"east_room__main_","speakers":[{"id":"ylis_falcone","name":"Yliès Falcone","bio":"Ylies Falcone is passionate about designing, implementing, integrating, and delivering methods and tools that help guarantee programs are safe and secure.
