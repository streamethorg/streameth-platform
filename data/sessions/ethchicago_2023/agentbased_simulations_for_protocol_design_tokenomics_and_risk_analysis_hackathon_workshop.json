{"id":"agentbased_simulations_for_protocol_design_tokenomics_and_risk_analysis_hackathon_workshop","name":"Agent-based simulations for protocol design, tokenomics, and risk analysis (hackathon workshop)","description":"This workshop is a technical tutorial aimed at upskilling developers and protocol stakeholders on how to build an agent-based simulation model for their protocol or Dapp, which can greatly improve their efficiency, security, and scalability. I will give a detailed walk-through on building a data-driven ABM using real world examples, and optionally a live coding demo. The session is designed to involve high output/engagement from the participants, where by the end everyone will have built a rudimentary agent-based model for a web3 protocol / Dapp of their choice.\r\n\r\nSome basic knowledge about smart contracts, DeFi concepts, and object-oriented programming would be helpful. No prior knowledge about quantitative modeling or data science required.","start":"2023-09-16T14:40:00.000Z","end":"2023-09-16T15:40:00.000Z","stageId":"lincoln_stage__builder__legal","speakers":[{"id":"mingxuan_he","name":"Mingxuan He","bio":null,"eventId":"ethchicago_2023","photo":""}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"ethchicago_2023","coverImage":"/sessions/ethchicago_2023/agentbased_simulations_for_protocol_design_tokenomics_and_risk_analysis_hackathon_workshop.jpg"}
