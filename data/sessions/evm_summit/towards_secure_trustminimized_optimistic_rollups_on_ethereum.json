  "description": "State-of-the-art optimistic rollups on Ethereum employ a monolithic interactive fraud proof mechanism that tightly couples an on-chain proof verifier with a specific L2 client program binary\u2014oblivious to the system's higher-level semantics. We argue that this approach (1) magnifies monoculture failure risk, by precluding trust-minimized and permissionless participation using operator-chosen client software; (2) leads to an unnecessarily large and difficult-to-audit TCB; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered, yet opaque upgrade process\u2014both further increasing auditing overhead, and broadening the governance attack surface.\n\nTo address these concerns, we outline a methodology for designing a secure and resilient rollup with a minimal TCB, by facilitating opportunistic 1-of-N-version programming. Due to its unique challenges and opportunities, we ground this work concretely in the context of the Ethereum\u2014where ORUs have gained significant traction. Specifically, we design a semantically-targeted IFP, featuring a proof system native to the EVM and its instruction set, as well as L2 consensus rules. We present an implementation in a new optimistic rollup, Specular, that opportunistically leverages Ethereum's existing client diversity with minimal source modification.",
