    "description": "Changes to the EVM have mostly been discussed on the \"ACDE\" (previously ACD) calls. Due to the immense number of proposed changes at various layers of the system, it is always a challenge to schedule them so that everyone's favorite features are included. As a result, changes to the EVM have mostly been prioritized based on the needs of other subsystems, such as the consensus layer. With the emergence of layer 2s, there is an unclear process of who should decide on the inclusion of features. This panel aims to discuss this topic and explore potential improvements in governance and coordination.",
