  "description": " Security of dApps can be compromised if adequate design precautions aren’t taken to shield both the nodes and the infrastructure supporting the underlying networks. Patched EVMs are big threat in the blockchain space, since they leave precompiled contracts that augment the core functionality of the original EVM, and implement custom logic and state patches over the EVM leading to unforeseen vulnerabilities. Inspired by OpenZeppelin’s Top 10 Blockchain Hacking Techniques report, this talk will delve into some prevalent attack vectors, and offer valuable tips to enhance EVM (equivalent) security.",
