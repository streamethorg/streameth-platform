Developing an innovative approach utilising Schnorr cryptography and secp256k1 public key aggregation, Chronicle Labs has vastly alleviated the gas fee burden that has limited on-chain Oracle scalability. This innovation unlocks the cost-effective implementation of Schnoor multi-signature in an EVM environment.","start":1699960200000,"end":1699961100000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"niklas_kunkel","name":"Niklas Kunkel","bio":"Founder of Chronicle Labs, the developers of Chronicle Protocol, Nik began his crypto journey at IBM Research, where he worked on the Hyperledger blockchain and early supply chain finance applications.
