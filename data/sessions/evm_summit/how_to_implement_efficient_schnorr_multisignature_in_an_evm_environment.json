    "description": "On-chain Oracles are limited by their ability to scale. Developing an innovative approach utilising Schnorr cryptography and secp256k1 public key aggregation, Chronicle Labs has vastly alleviated the gas fee burden that has limited on-chain Oracle scalability. This innovation unlocks the cost-effective implementation of Schnoor multi-signature in an EVM environment.",

An industry-standard account abstraction primitive, OasisDEX, the first decentralized exchange on Ethereum with an order matching engine, as well as Chronicle Oracle Protocol, which secures over $10B of assets locked in MakerDAO.",
