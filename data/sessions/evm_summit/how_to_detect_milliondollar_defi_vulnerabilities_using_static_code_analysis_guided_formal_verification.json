Formal verification is a promising technique that can prevent such exploits before deployment. However, formal verification has its limits due to the underlying problems often being computationally undecidable. In this talk, we will show how the Certora Prover leverages static code analysis to scale automated formal verification to real-world programs thus making your DeFi code more secure. The talk will also discuss some of the key challenges about how memory allocation happens on the EVM and how it is used by the compiler.","start":1699959000000,"end":1699959900000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"john_toman","name":"John Toman","bio":"Dr. John Toman is the VP of R&D at Certora Inc.
