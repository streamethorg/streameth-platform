{"id":"mevm_private_evm_computation_for_mev","name":"MEVM: Private EVM Computation for MEV","description":"In this talk we go over SUAVE's use of a modified EVM, the MEVM, to perform private computation on a network of SGX nodes using modified precompiles. These MEV specific precompiles use WASM and can trigger computation on other domains as well as route information on the SUAVE network.","start":1699957800000,"end":1699958700000,"stageId":"emirgan_1","speakers":[{"id":"daniel_marzec_dmarz","name":"Daniel Marzec (dmarz)","bio":"SUAVE Protocol R&D","eventId":"evm_summit","twitter":"","photo":"https://evmsummit.org/images/speakers/daniel_marzec.jpg"}],"videoUrl":"Layer 2 and zkEVMs","eventId":"evm_summit","coverImage":"/sessions/evm_summit/mevm_private_evm_computation_for_mev.jpg"}
