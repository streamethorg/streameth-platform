Bobola worked at JCi, EY, and PwC, where he worked on top hedge fund and private equity clients. He has been fascinated with blockchain and other Web3 technologies since 2017. Bobola Co-led the PwC Blockchain Community of Interest and trained colleagues on utilizing emerging technologies to serve clients better. As he became more involved in the field, he started seeking \u201creal use cases\u201d for the technology. In 2020, he found what he was looking for in the business of international money transfers. He created a way for immigrants and international travelers to use blockchain technology to send money to their families back home. His plan made these money transfers cheaper and faster than anything else on the market. And best of all, it creates passive income opportunities for its users.",
