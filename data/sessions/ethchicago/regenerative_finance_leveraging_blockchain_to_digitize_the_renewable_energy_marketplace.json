    "description": "The existing renewable energy certificate (REC) marketplace is similar to booking travel in the 1990s with a great deal of manual work and brokers (e.g., travel agents) - the internet and Expedia, among others, replaced that system. Innovo Markets is building the same thing for the REC marketplace so power producers (solar, wind, hydro) can sell their RECs directly to corporations (Amazon, Apple) instantaneously instead of a 30-60 day lag. New laws are creating tailwinds in the space that are estimated to grow the market from $20 billion today to over $110 billion by 2030. Using blockchain as the underlying technology to build the digital marketplace streamlines the buying/selling of RECs and creates a transparent record of activity.",
