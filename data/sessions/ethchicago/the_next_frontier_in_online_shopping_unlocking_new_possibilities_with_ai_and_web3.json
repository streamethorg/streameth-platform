    "description": "Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technology are revolutionizing the e-commerce industry. This technology has the potential to enhance e-commerce experiences, drive revenue for businesses, and deepen consumer-brand relationships.\r\n\r\nThe session specifically examines three core use cases of blockchain and AI in e-commerce: commerce co-creation, proof of custody, and immersive e-commerce. Commerce co-creation allows brands to co-create new products and experiences with their consumers, while proof of custody ensures the authenticity and provenance of products. Immersive e-commerce uses virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to create more engaging and interactive shopping experiences.\r\n\r\nThe use of blockchain and AI in e-commerce is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to fundamentally reshape the way we shop online. \r\n\r\nSome use cases discussed: \r\n\r\n1. Traditional e-commerce platforms are static and fail to engage online shoppers.\r\n2. Blockchain and AI can be used to create more personalized, interactive, and immersive e-commerce experiences.\r\n3. Commerce co-creation allows brands to co-create new products and experiences with their consumers.\r\n4. Proof of custody ensures the authenticity and provenance of products.",
