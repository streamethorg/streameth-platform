    "description": "You may have heard that crypto gives you a \"Swiss bank account in your pocket\" or \"not your keys, not your coins\" but the reality is that these properties are enabled by self-custody of digital assets, which can be a daunting prospect for many people. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this talk is to focus on what you \"need to know\" to do your own self-custody, give an overview of available tools, and show how get started using DeFi applications. \r\n\r\nEnjoy the full benefits of digital assets by creating a secure setup for your non-sovereign stores of value like a Crypto Jason Bourne.",
