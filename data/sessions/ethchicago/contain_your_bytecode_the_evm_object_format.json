  "name": "Contain your Bytecode: The EVM Object Format",
  "description": "The EVM Object Format is a container format for the existing EVM architecture that provides  the needed structure to provide several long desired improvements to the EVM seen in other VM frameworks (such as subroutines and linear transpiration) while removing problematic features such as code observability and gas schedule incompatibility. This talk will provide byte-code level examples of major aspects of the code. EOF is targeting release in a hard fork after Dencun.",
