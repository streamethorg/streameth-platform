Carlos Robles-Shanahan and Rafael Robles\r\n\r\nDuo is a Chicago-based innovation studio/lab with the mission to create built environment innovations for the benefit of society. Duo's signature design methodology, Multicontextual Design, promotes norm/form-making which enables us to (re)shape dominant norms and set new precedents through our work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presentation will give a foundation of the importance and impact of real estate assets on the unequal distribution of wealth in the United States, and follow it with a presentation of two projects that will be among the first in Chicago to use equity crowdfunding to open investment opportunities for commercial and residential buildings to neighbors and non-accredited investors. The presentation can finish with an open conversation about how ETH, Blockchain and other emerging technologies can further promote ethical interventions in physical environments.",
