  "description": "In the quest for mass adoption, the Web3 world is in dire need of skilled developers who can create groundbreaking decentralized applications (Dapps). However, the current availability of quality Web3 developers falls significantly short. With approximately 28 million Web2 developers compared to a mere 21,000 Web3 developers worldwide, the stark reality emerges: there exists a staggering 1300X order of magnitude difference, equivalent to a meager 0.075% representation. In this talk, we will explore the pressing need to bridge this gap and transform Web3 developer education to propel the industry towards widespread adoption.",
