  "description": "Innovations in governance will be critical if we are going to address grand societal challenges identified by the U.N. SDGs. Research is underway to design a value-chain level blockchain based governance and operations model to effectively support the achievement of a range of pressing humanitarian social goals (e.g., stable global supply of food, access to affordable housing, regional circular economies). Called the \u201cSocial Purpose Value Chain\u201d (SPVC), this system level concept is based on the idea that a combination of blockchain technology, coopetition, reimagination of value-chain analysis in the context of social goal achievement, a relational bureaucratic governance model that is vertically integrated (i.e., shared governance by members of each step of a value chain), and a social credit incentive system would overcome several known barriers to social goal achievement (e.g., such as power and hierarchy issues in decision making, donor-driven solutions that do not effectively or efficiently address needs, contract execution failures). The SPVC concept, the status of the software research prototype supporting it, and next steps will be discussed.",
