      "bio": "Meditation & Creativity Coach for Software Engineers, Builders, and Creators. \r\n\r\nFueled by boundless curiosity and a passion for human mastery, my journey has been anything but linear. I love learning and trying new things, constantly exploring new avenues and expanding my mind in different dimensions. \r\n\r\nWith a Computer Science degree from UIUC, I've delved deep into the tech world, working as a software engineer at Facebook and as the Head of Product at small startups. Now, I'm sharing my technical expertise as a coach at Interview Kickstart, helping software engineers prepare for frontend engineering interviews at top tech companies.\r\n\r\nBut that's just one side of me.\r\n\r\nI have been a rapper since I was 14, releasing albums and even pushed my limits by freestyle rapping for 38 minutes straight, which laid the foundation for my mixtape \"Better Than Before.\" I've hosted a podcast and built online communities. I've performed live as an improviser, a rapper, and a stand up comedian. I've uploaded almost 800 videos to my YouTube channel and created thousands of ai-generated art. \r\n\r\nThrough it all, my breath has been my anchor, with a daily meditation practice complemented by 10-day intensive courses. With a sense of peace, purpose, and renewed clarity, I've transitioned into a career as a meditation and creativity coach. In a world that's constantly redefining itself, I\u2019m here to guide leaders, especially from the tech and creative worlds, to stay centered and maximize the opportunities this era offers.\r\n\r\nIf you're a software engineer, builder, or creator looking for a bridge between logic and imagination, between code and artistry, let's connect. I'm here to be a bridge between dreams and reality.\r\n\r\nDM me on Telegram: @DavidProrok or Instagram @david.prorok!",
