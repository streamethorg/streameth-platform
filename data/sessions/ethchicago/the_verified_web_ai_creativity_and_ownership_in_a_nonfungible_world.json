  "description": "With the emergence of generative AI, the value of novel information has escalated exponentially. Determining the origin of information has become more significant, making verification necessary. Today, we explore the idea of \"The Verified Web\" and using  Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a way to establish ownership of verified data and information. By indexing data on-chain, the World Wide Web will be divided into verifiable and \"unverified\" segments.",
