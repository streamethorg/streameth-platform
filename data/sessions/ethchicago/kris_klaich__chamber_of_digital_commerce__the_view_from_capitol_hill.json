            "bio": "Kris Klaich is an entrepreneur/international development consultant-turned crypto asset enthusiast, having worked in economic development and international security in the Middle East and Central/Southeast Asia. His travel to 84 countries brought him face to face with the dearth of opportunities available to many simply by the lottery of birth and developed in me a joy for cultural exchange.\r\n\r\nBeginning in early 2020 Kris became inexorably drawn into the digital asset universe and its potential to level playing fields, enable voices to be heard uncensored and provide access to new forms of value and economic activity indiscriminately. Kris is fascinated both by the solutions it promises across nearly every industry in the world as well as its breathtaking acceleration of innovation exploding in a thousand vectors. This inspired him to first become a Certified Bitcoin Professional, and now obtain a Masters in Blockchain and Digital Currency at the University of Nicosia Institute for the Future and Republic Realm Academy\u2019s certificate in Metaverse Technologies. He loves sharing what he has learned and connecting friends and colleagues around the world with educational and platform tools that facilitate their transition to the digital economy.",
