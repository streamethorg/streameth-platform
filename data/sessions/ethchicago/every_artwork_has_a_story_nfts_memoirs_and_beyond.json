Since then, we have built a digital art market that spans style, genre, geography, language, and more. Not only has the NFT ecosystem proven the value of digital art, it has also challenged the traditional art market, and in doing so found a place for digital art within the upper echelons of the art world.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in a world where there are millions (and one day trillions) of NFTs, how do we capture the history, the cultural significance, the very story of each piece of digital art?\r\n\r\n\r\nMint Gold Dust has always cared about the stories behind NFTs, which is why we pioneered the memoir feature, which is a piece of text that accompanies an artwork. But in our recently launched v2, we take it one step further. We preserve that memoir on the blockchain and tie it to the NFT artwork. For the archeologists of the future, NFTs minted on our platform will not only tell the visual story of our times, but also have a written counterpart onchain. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that this technology will help creators to preserve history and document the digital renaissance that we are witnessing before us today.","start":"2023-09-16T17:30:00-05:00","end":"2023-09-16T18:00:00-05:00","stageId":"michigan_stage__creatives__trad_business_","speakers":[{"id":"virginia_valenzuela","name":"Virginia Valenzuela","bio":null,"eventId":"ethchicago","photo":""}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"ethchicago","coverImage":"/sessions/ethchicago/every_artwork_has_a_story_nfts_memoirs_and_beyond.jpg"}
