Since then he’s worked in cybersecurity and distributed ledger technology at all levels of the stack including developing a loyalty points exchange for the NASDAQ subsidiary, designing Web3 solutions for ESG markets, and building a peer-to-peer product exchange for the developing world. Now he is the co-creator of Notoros: a zero trust developer platform built to meet the needs of highly regulated industries and US critical infrastructure.
