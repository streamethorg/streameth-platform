{"id":"longevity_zero_to_one_computational_bio_tools__tech_paths","name":"Longevity Zero to One: Computational Bio, Tools & Tech Paths","description":"Session 11: Computational Bio &amp; Tech Paths\n\n\nThis session has two parts. Part 1 covers topics in computational biology. Part 2 covers alternative tech development paths adjacent to longevity.&nbsp;\n\nTopics:\n\n- Computational modeling\n- Machine learning\n- Full computation bio models\n- Hibernation\n- Cryonics\n- Uploading\n- Prosthetics\n- Synthetic organs&nbsp;\n\nAbout the course\n\n\nLongevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.\n\n\nAttending all sessions is highly recommended.\n\n\nIf you don’t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!","start":"2023-05-10T10:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-05-10T11:00:00.000Z","stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"cat_thu","name":"Cat Thu","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_2023__longevity_01","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"},{"id":"ksenia_winslow","name":"Ksenia Winslow","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_2023__longevity_01","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/4f25xp4ahrh1zwoe/index.m3u8","playbackId":"4f25xp4ahrh1zwoe","eventId":"zuzalu_2023__longevity_01"}
