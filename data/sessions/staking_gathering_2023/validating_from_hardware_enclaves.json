    "description": "In this user-centric talk we'll briefly recap common validator key protection schemes and introduce validating via remote signing from hardware enclaves with the help of secure-signer.\nWe'll moreover conceptually elaborate on how hardware enclaves mimic hardware wallet functionality combined with built-in slashing protection and discuss potential advantages & trade-offs in the staking context.\nIn form of a brief demonstration of a testing environment, we'll present a PoC for validating from hardware enclaves with an at-home SGX-setup on a NUC, using docker-compose on ephemery testnet.",
