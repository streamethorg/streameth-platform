{"id":"validating_from_hardware_enclaves","name":"Validating from hardware enclaves","description":"In this user-centric talk we'll briefly recap common validator key protection schemes and introduce validating via remote signing from hardware enclaves with the help of secure-signer.\nWe'll moreover conceptually elaborate on how hardware enclaves mimic hardware wallet functionality combined with built-in slashing protection and discuss potential advantages & trade-offs in the staking context.\nIn form of a brief demonstration of a testing environment, we'll present a PoC for validating from hardware enclaves with an at-home SGX-setup on a NUC, using docker-compose on ephemery testnet.","start":1699961700000,"end":1699962900000,"stageId":"connie","speakers":[{"id":"ladislaus_von_daniels","name":"Ladislaus von Daniels","bio":"EthStaker\nCommunity member","eventId":"staking_gathering_2023","twitter":"","photo":"https://avatars.sched.co/e/6e/19160280/avatar.jpg?1d3"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"staking_gathering_2023","coverImage":"/sessions/staking_gathering_2023/validating_from_hardware_enclaves.jpg"}
