No magic, no false promises, real facts and examples.\nI'm going to talk about a variety of either freely or cheap available AI models to do the following:\n1. Create a code\n    a) Front End\n    b) Back End including Smart contracts in Solidity\n2. Test the code\n    a) Validating Smart contracts against the best practices\n    b) Creating the test cases\n    c) creating the code for functional tests\n3. Marketing & Communications (briefly as I expect we won't have time)\n    a) Creating documentation\n    b) Ctearing texts for community management\n    c) Event management support: ads, avatars, logos",
