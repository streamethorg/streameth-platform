{"id":"andrew_brick","name":"Andrew Brick","bio":"Andrew got started in the Blockchain space over 11 years ago, prior to earning a Master’s of Electrical Engineering. Since then he’s worked in cybersecurity and distributed ledger technology at all levels of the stack including developing a loyalty points exchange for the NASDAQ subsidiary, designing Web3 solutions for ESG markets, and building a peer-to-peer product exchange for the developing world. Now he is the co-creator of Notoros: a zero trust developer platform built to meet the needs of highly regulated industries and US critical infrastructure. Last year his team graduated from an accelerator hosted by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and earlier this summer was part of the inaugural cohort of University of Chicago's Transform accelerator.","eventId":"ethchicago_2023","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/AndrewHeadshot_83a9CM3.png"}
