{"id":"lauren_tierney","name":"Lauren Tierney","bio":"Lauren Tierney is a venture investor at Decasonic, a web3 venture, and digital assets fund based in Chicago. In her role at Decasonic, she focuses on finding outlier founders across her theses that focus on web3 commerce, web3 fashion, and web3 wellness amongst others. Lauren feels that for web3 to truly reach mainstream consumers it has to solve a web2 problem with web3 technology and/or make someone's life 10x daily life better. She sees commerce, fashion, and wellness as ways to revolutionize consumers' experiences and genuinely make consumersâ€™ lives better in ways they cannot ignore. On her podcast, Allowlist, Lauren sits down with founders and her co-hosts to discuss similar use cases. Allowlist is a weekly podcast about the future of consumers - the companies creating it, the technologies powering it, and the VCs funding it co-hosted by Stef Caldwell. They cover topics from web3, AI, and blockchain technologies to broader movements we see in consumer trends.","eventId":"ethchicago","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/LT_Final_2.0_dazAUwO.JPG"}
