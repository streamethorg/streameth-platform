{"id":"nico_serrano","name":"Nico Serrano","bio":"I am a software developer that believes trustless applications are a great way to balance power and fairness in our actual systems. I'm currently working on the Privacy & Scaling Explorations team at the Ethereum Foundation on different projects focused on trusted setups and state channels. \n\nWhile being part of the team that build the KZG Ceremony I learned a lot about the \"moon math\" behind trusted setups that sometimes scares developers into delving to the ZK world. I feel that my experience as a developer/builder might help you out understand a bit more about trusted setups/ceremonies and the ZK landscape.","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcWUwKF8DQws8VpD3DOsuRaGcY_yahJW/view"}
