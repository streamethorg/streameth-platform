{"id":"sachin_kumar","name":"Sachin Kumar","bio":"Currently I'm building ZKP2P (https://twitter.com/zkp2p), built on top of zk email and funded by a PSE grant, and zkCerts which I started building this as part of the latest Axiom Open Source Cohort. I'm excited about building zk apps that leverage off-chain provenant data and gave a talk on the same at ZK Summit 10 London. Excited to scale zk apps to solve some of the toughest long-standing challenges in crypto.","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uv9NE4_cWQQB6_eefMVyLxKixOoI7wo_/view"}
