{"id":"wei_dai","name":"Wei Dai","bio":"My background is in Cryptography, having focused on concrete provable security during my PhD, advised by Mihir Bellare. My current interest is broadly in the applications of cryptography to trust-minimized applications, as a researcher, builder, and investor. My goal is to push the space of trust-minimized applications forward, by identifying and contributing to high impact research areas, facilitating technology transfer from research to applications, and in supporting projects and founders closely during the early stages. I believe that Programmable Cryptography uniquely enables the addition of privacy and scalability to trust-minimized applications. I strive to stay at the forefront of the theory, implementation, and commercialization of this area of technology.\n\nSome examples of my recent work:\n- My work on FLAX (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1249.pdf) led to a Ethereum privacy project called Nocturne (https://nocturnelabs.xyz/), of which I'm a core protocol designer.\n- My work on PESCA (https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1119.pdf) was one of the first to propose the usage of threshold FHE to build on-chain confidential compute. This design has since been practically implemented in efforts such as fhEVM by Zama.","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QU2d9WDateEo7pI0PLfaU5fKdtszCjhj/view"}
