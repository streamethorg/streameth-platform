  "bio": "I work for the Swarm Foundation where I recently led the project Wikipedia on Swarm, to make a web3 censorship resistant copy of Wikipedia. Prior to that, I was community manager with the Golem Network. I have a MSc in Law, Anthropology and Society from the London School of Economics, where I focused on the interplay between State Secrecy and Democratic Governance. But my passion for freedom of speech goes way back: my father was a satirical cartoonist and a political journalist, he was often the target of censorship attempts so itâ€™s a family affair.",
