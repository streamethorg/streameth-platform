Over the last two years, he shifted to launching a Rust project called \"trin.\" trin is a pre-release client for the upcoming Portal network. This peer-to-peer network will provide on-demand access to core Ethereum chain data. We aim to provide a brand new way to read from the Layer 1 Ethereum network, that doesn't keep all the baggage of standard execution clients.
