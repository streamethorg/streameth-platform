Having built dozens of dApps, protocols and full chains from both mass-market and government clients, Silur is also a co-organizer of the largest Capture the flag event on the planet, in which he challenges the best hackers in the world to break blockchain systems and reproduce historical cryptocurrency hacks. Silur is also a member of the Wigner's research centre of physics where he specializes on quantum computation and post-quantum cryptography. He took a place on the Forbes 30 under 30 list for his achievments in cybersecurity and web3.","eventId":"swarm_summit_2023","twitter":"https://summit.ethswarm.org/media/avatars/silur_GFV1vZ2.jpeg"}
