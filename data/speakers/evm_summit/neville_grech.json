{"id":"neville_grech","name":"Neville Grech","bio":"I am the Director and co-founder of Dedaub. My expertise is focused on program analysis, mostly applied to security applications. Before Dedaub I had a mostly academic career. I have authored the first work that applies static analysis to the security of smart contracts, this work was subsequently highlighted by ACM SIGPLAN and Communications of the ACM Throughout my career I've also developed novel techniques and tools in the areas of energy efficient software development, smart contracts, semantics and generative programming. Some popular tools I have codeveloped include decompilers and security analyzers for the Ethereum platform (MadMax and Gigahorse) and Java pointer and taint analysis frameworks (Doop, P/Taint and HeapDL). Previously, I was Reach High Fellow at the University of Athens, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, and have worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. I hold a PhD from the University of Southampton.","eventId":"evm_summit","twitter":"","photo":"https://evmsummit.org/images/speakers/neville_grech.jpg"}
