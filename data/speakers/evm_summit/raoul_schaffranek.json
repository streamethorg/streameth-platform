{"id":"raoul_schaffranek","name":"Raoul Schaffranek","bio":"Raoul Schaffranek studied Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, where he obtained B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees. He wrote his master thesis about compositional modeling and fully automated verification of distributed systems and formalized his findings with the Isabelle proof assistant. Before joining RV, Raoul worked for more than eight years as a software engineer for the German software company graphodata AG. Raoul considers programming a human-centric rather than machine-centric activity, and he firmly believes that we should build modern programming languages and verification tools upon this perspective.","eventId":"evm_summit","twitter":"","photo":"https://evmsummit.org/images/speakers/raoul_schaffranek.jpg"}
