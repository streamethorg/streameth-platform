My adventure began with my Twitter account (@doganeth). I started writing what I posted there since I think writing is the best method to learn.\n\nI began writing articles about blockchain about 1.5 years ago. I began my work as a columnist, and thousands of people have read my articles. I then became a researcher analyst for the Lytera team.\n\nI am now focusing on blockchain infrastructure, modular blockchains, and other things.\n","eventId":"ethgunu","twitter":"@DoganEth","photo":"https://github.com/ethgunu/ethgunu.com/blob/main/src/components/main/Speakers/photos/dogan.jpg?raw=true"}
