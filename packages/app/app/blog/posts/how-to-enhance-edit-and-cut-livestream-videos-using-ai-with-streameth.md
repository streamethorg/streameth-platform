# How to enhance, edit and cut livestream videos using AI with StreamETH

Editing videos has never been easier. With the power of AI, you can save time and effort while producing high-quality content. StreamETH brings that experience directly to you with its integrated AI tools.

## Transcription: Your Gateway to AI Editing

Start your AI-powered workflow by transcribing your livestream. StreamETH can transcribe hours of video in under 10 minutes, converting speech to text so you can easily navigate through long recordings. Scroll through the transcript, jump to key moments, and locate specific sections instantly.

## AI Prompt Highlights: Find Key Moments with a Command

Take advantage of AI prompts to quickly identify the most important parts of your video. Simply type in commands like:

- "Create a clip of presenter 1"
- "Highlight the panel discussion"
- "Show moments with audience Q&A"

The AI will scan the transcript and marker clips based on your request, making highlight creation faster and smarter.
