# From long form content to short form within minutes. Make great impact videos fast.

Organizing and executing an event is never an easy task, and we know that efficiency is key in this nerve-wracking scenario. At StreamETH, we simplify and optimize content creation, a crucial part of this complex process.

## The Challenge

Once an event is over, a new problem arises: how do you quickly turn hours of footage into social-ready content before the audience moves on? In today's fast-paced digital world, immediacy is everything. If your content isn't available fast enough, you risk losing momentum and engagement.

## Why Is This a Problem?

Editing videos takes too long. Most editing tools require experience, and even with a team, it can take days or weeks to create short clips that are ready for social media. Meanwhile, your audience is already looking for the next big thing.

## The Solution

StreamETH makes video editing fast, simple, and accessible to everyone, no experience needed. Our intuitive tool allows you to cut content in real-time, even while the broadcast is still ongoing. That means you can create and share videos meanwhile or moments after your event ends, keeping engagement high.

Cut videos in real-time: start selecting key moments while the event is still live.

1. Post faster: have ready-to-share clips minutes after your event ends.
2. No complicated programs required: everything happens online, no downloads needed.
3. No need for a high-performance computer: works smoothly on any device.
4. Easier uploads: organize and share your event highlights effortlessly

## The Result

- More engagement - Keep your audience interested with fresh content.
- Less effort - No need for professional editors or complex tools.
- Stronger brand presence - Make sure your event is seen, shared, and remembered.

Save costs and time with less stressful situations!

All of this is possible thanks to [StreamETH.](https://info.streameth.org/)
