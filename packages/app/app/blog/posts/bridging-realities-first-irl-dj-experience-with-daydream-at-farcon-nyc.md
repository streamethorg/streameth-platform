# Bridging Realities: First IRL DJ Experience with Daydream at FarCon NYC

On May 1st, our team had the incredible opportunity to participate in FarCon NYC, an event at the intersection of Web3, creative technology, and community building. Organized by RefractionDAO and Syndicate, and powered by Daydream and Livepeer, the event was streamed live to a global audience through UFO.fm. As StreamETH, we supported the event with streaming infrastructure and technical coordination, that made this hybrid experience possible.

## A Fusion of Music and Generative AI

At the heart of the evening was a captivating performance that marked a first in live entertainment: the first-ever in-person DJ set enhanced by Daydream's generative AI visuals.

These visuals weren't just aesthetic backdrops, they were dynamically generated in real-time, responding to the artist curated list of prompts. The visuals alternated between highlighting the DJ and engaging the audience, creating a dynamic, immersive experience.

## Interactive and Immersive

One of the most compelling aspects of the event was the interactivity built into the visuals. Audience members could see themselves projected onto the screen as part of the AI-generated visuals, turning spectators into co-creators. The experience blurred the lines between performer and audience, transforming the event into a co-created moment.

This wasn't just a show, it was a prototype for the future of live digital performance. Real-time streaming ensured that the energy, spontaneity, and artistry of the event weren't confined to the venue but reached a distributed community around the world. Our team at StreamETH ensured seamless integration between the physical and digital environments, coordinating across technical layers to deliver a synchronized, high-quality broadcast. We're excited to continue supporting innovative projects that push the boundaries of music, technology, and art.
