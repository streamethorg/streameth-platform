# How to Share and Maximize Your Impact with Livestreaming on StreamETH

Standing out in the livestreaming industry is no easy feat. Capturing attention both physically and online requires the right tools and strategies. At StreamETH, we're committed to providing you with the best tools to make your events truly shine.

## How Can StreamETH Help You Share Your Content?

StreamETH offers multiple ways to share your content with a global audience. Our goal is to elevate your audiovisual content to the next level. While StreamETH is primarily designed for broadcasting live events, its capabilities extend far beyond that. Here's what you can do with StreamETH:

## 1. Livestreaming

Livestreaming is the most popular use of our platform. With StreamETH, you can broadcast live (publicly or privately) using the industry-leading on-chain server, Livepeer. Setting up a livestream is quick and easy, you can start streaming in under ten minutes using OBS and StreamETH. Follow the step-by-step tutorial below to get started:

You can choose to start an instant livestream or schedule one for the future. Additionally, you can:

- Stream to multiple platforms simultaneously, including X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and more.
- Embed your livestream: If you want to display your livestream on your own website, you can do so using the embed feature. Simply go to your stream's **Share** button, copy the provided embed code and paste it into your website's HTML. This feature ensures your audience can watch directly from your site without being redirected.
- Share your StreamETH link directly via the share button.

## 2. Multiple Livestreaming

If you need to run multiple livestreams at the same time, StreamETH makes it possible. Simply follow the same setup process to create additional streams. Ensure your account has the appropriate package to support multiple streams.

## 3. Channel Showcase

Your content doesn't disappear after the livestream ends. StreamETH provides a dedicated channel page where viewers can:

- Access previously uploaded public videos.
- Browse upcoming livestreams.
- Explore curated playlists, allowing for better content organization and easy navigation.

Best of all, your channel is ad-free, ensuring an uninterrupted viewing experience for your audience.

## 4. Upload Videos

In addition to livestreaming, you can upload videos directly to your channel showcase. Your uploaded content (including livestream recordings, clips, and standalone videos) remains accessible for future use and can be downloaded at any time.

## 5. Built-in Video Editing

StreamETH includes an integrated editing tool, allowing you to highlight and share the best moments from your content. The "Clip Live" feature enables you to create and share clips while you're still streaming and there is no more no need to wait until the livestream ends.

Once clips are uploaded, they can be showcased on your channel page. Don't forget to set them to public in the edit section of your library. You can also clip previously recorded livestreams and uploaded videos at any time.

Check out our tutorial below to learn how to clip videos easily.
