# 5 keys for your event livestream to be a success

Whether you're shooting a short film, running a livestream, producing a branded video, or launching a Web3 creative project, these five principles will keep your workflow smooth and your results professional:

## Plan Everything Ahead of Time

The more you prepare, the fewer surprises you'll face during production. Build a detailed pre-production plan: include a shooting schedule, gear checklist, shot list, script breakdowns, and backup plans.

Even spontaneous projects benefit from structure, it gives you the freedom to be creative without drowning in chaos.

## Prioritize Audio & Visual Quality

Invest in decent microphones, lighting, and camera gear. You don't need to break the bank, but viewers will forgive a slightly soft image, but they won't forgive distorted sound, or echo-filled dialogue or dim/distorted images.

## Test Your Tech Thoroughly

Before the shoot or livestream, test everything. That means your camera settings, cables, file formats, SD cards, mic levels, livestream connections, internet stability and export presets. Don't assume anything works, verify it.

## Communicate

Clear communication between crew members, clients, and collaborators is non-negotiable. Know who's responsible for what, when assets are due, and how feedback will be shared. Real-time communication during the event or shoot is just as critical. Whether it's calling cues during a live broadcast, adjusting camera movements on set, or syncing edits remotely, timely updates can make or break the flow.

## Promote Before, During, and After

Your content doesn't start with the final export â€” it starts with anticipation. Build hype before you release anything. During production, share behind-the-scenes glimpses. Once it's live, keep the momentum going. Start editing highlights and clipping your most wanted moments with [StreamETH](https://info.streameth.org/). Start feeding your audience even meanwhile the show is still rolling!

- **Before:** teasers, storyboards, social media sharing
- **During:** on-set photos, BTS videos, polls, live clips
- **After:** trailers, Q&As, reaction posts, highlights
