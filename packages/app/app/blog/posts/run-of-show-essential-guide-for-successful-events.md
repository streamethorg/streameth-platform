Whether you're planning a corporate event, a music festival, or a television broadcast, one essential tool you'll need is a run of show. But what exactly is a run of show and why do you need one?

## What is a run of show?

A run of show is a detailed document or timeline that outlines the sequence of events or activities in a broadcasted program. It serves as a roadmap for event organizers, production teams, and participants, ensuring that everyone is on the same page about what needs to happen and when.

While the complexity of a run of show can vary based on the event's size and nature, it typically includes key details such as the time of each activity, the persons involved, the equipment needed, and any special instructions. It's a critical tool for ensuring smooth transitions between different segments of an event and preventing any unforeseen hiccups.

## The importance of a run of show

### 1. Ensures cross-team coordination

A well-crafted run of show allows everyone involved to understand their roles and responsibilities, reducing the chances of confusion or miscommunication on the day of the event.

Moreover, a run of show helps to coordinate different teams and departments, ensuring that everyone is working in sync. This is particularly important for larger events where multiple teams may be working simultaneously on different aspects of the event.

### 2. Helps manage time effectively

A run of show is also a valuable tool for time management. By outlining the timing for each segment of the event, it helps to keep everything on track and prevent delays. This is particularly important for events with strict time constraints, such as live broadcasts or conferences.

Furthermore, a run of show can also help in planning and scheduling rehearsals or sound checks, ensuring that everything is ready before the event starts.

## Creating a run of show

The first step in creating a run of show is to identify the key elements of your event. This includes:

- The various segments or activities
- The participants involved
- The equipment needed
- Any special instructions

Once you've identified the key elements of your event, the next step is to sequence them in the order they will occur. This will form the backbone of your run of show. Consider factors such as the flow of the event, the availability of participants, and the setup and teardown times for equipment.

Also, build in some buffer time between activities to account for any unexpected delays or issues. This can help to ensure that your event stays on track, even if something doesn't go as planned.

## Tips for an effective run of show

### 1. Keep it detailed but simple

Use clear headings, bullet points, tables, diagrams, and charts to present information in a structured and organized manner. Also, use clear language and avoid jargon. Remember, the goal is to create a document that everyone involved in the event can easily follow.

### 2. Communicate and collaborate

A run of show is a collaborative document. It's important to involve all key stakeholders in its creation, including event planners, production teams and participants. This not only ensures that everyone's needs are considered, but also promotes ownership and accountability.

Once the run of show is created, make sure to announce it to everyone involved. This can be done through email, meetings, or dedicated event management software. Regular updates and reminders can also help to ensure that everyone is aware of the plan and any changes to it.

### 3. Be flexible and adaptable

Finally, while a run of show provides a structured plan for your event, it's important to be flexible and adaptable. Things may not always go as planned, and being able to adjust and adapt your run of show as needed is crucial for managing unexpected situations.

## Conclusion

A run of show is an indispensable tool for any successful event, whether it's a small corporate meeting or a large-scale festival. By providing a clear roadmap of what needs to happen and when, it ensures that all team members are aligned and that the event runs smoothly from start to finish.

Remember, the key to an effective run of show lies in its detail, clarity, and flexibility. Take the time to create a comprehensive document that accounts for all aspects of your event, communicate it clearly to all stakeholders, and be prepared to adapt as circumstances change.

With a well-crafted run of show in hand, you'll be well-equipped to deliver an event that not only meets but exceeds expectations, creating memorable experiences for all participants and attendees.
