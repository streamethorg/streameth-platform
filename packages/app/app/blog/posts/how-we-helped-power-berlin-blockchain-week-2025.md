# How We Helped Power Berlin Blockchain Week 2025

Berlin Blockchain Week 2025 brought together the global Web3 community for a week of ideas, innovation, and connection. As the AV and livestreaming team behind many of the week's flagship events, StreamETH had the honor of making much of it accessible to the world in real time.

From full AV production to remote stream delivery and lightning-fast post-production, we were everywhere. Thanks to Livepeer, the decentralized video infrastructure that made it all scalable, reliable, and Web3-native.

## Our Week in Berlin

### June 11 â€“ D/Acc

We kicked off our week supporting D/Acc, focused on data availability and zero-knowledge infrastructure. Our role here was stream-focused, ensuring global accessibility for an audience spread far beyond Berlin. While our involvement was light compared to later events, we were proud to help broadcast high-impact technical content from day one.

### June 12â€“13 â€“ Protocol Berg

This event gave us the chance to handle full AV on-site, from audio engineering to video capture and live production. With so many deep technical sessions packed into two days, clarity and reliability were non-negotiable and we delivered.

### June 14 â€“ Daydream @Night

A truly unique and immersive experience, Daydream combined art, music, and AI storytelling. Our AV team adapted to a non-traditional format with creative setups and responsive execution, capturing the magic and amplifying it beyond the walls of the venue.

### June 15â€“20 â€“ ZÃœBerlin

Our role at ZÃœBerlin was livestream-only. Across this extended multi-day gathering, we worked behind the scenes to deliver smooth, consistent broadcast quality for virtual participants.

### June 16â€“18 â€“ Dappcon

The anchor of the week for many, Dappcon was where our full capabilities came to life. Not only did we deliver high-quality livestreams across multiple stages, we also managed to clip and cut all post-event videos incredibly fast, giving organizers and speakers content they could instantly share. This event highlighted the full stack of what we do best: live, post, and everything in between.

## Powered by Livepeer

A massive thank-you to Livepeer, our streaming infrastructure partner.

Livepeer was the silent powerhouse in our workflow, keeping things fast, secure, and on-chain-aligned.

## What We Learned

- **Hybrid is the new normal**: People want access, wherever they are. We help make that happen.
- **Speed matters**: Our rapid post-production turnaround at Dappcon was a clear win.
- **Creativity demands flexibility**: Especially for events like Daydream, where no two moments were alike.
