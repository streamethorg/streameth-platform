    "description": "This workshop is a technical tutorial aimed at upskilling developers and protocol stakeholders on how to build an agent-based simulation model for their protocol or Dapp, which can greatly improve their efficiency, security, and scalability. I will give a detailed walk-through on building a data-driven ABM using real world examples, and optionally a live coding demo. The session is designed to involve high output/engagement from the participants, where by the end everyone will have built a rudimentary agent-based model for a web3 protocol / Dapp of their choice.\r\n\r\nSome basic knowledge about smart contracts, DeFi concepts, and object-oriented programming would be helpful. No prior knowledge about quantitative modeling or data science required.",

    "description": "Innovations in governance will be critical if we are going to address grand societal challenges identified by the U.N. SDGs. Research is underway to design a value-chain level blockchain based governance and operations model to effectively support the achievement of a range of pressing humanitarian social goals (e.g., stable global supply of food, access to affordable housing, regional circular economies). Called the “Social Purpose Value Chain” (SPVC), this system level concept is based on the idea that a combination of blockchain technology, coopetition, reimagination of value-chain analysis in the context of social goal achievement, a relational bureaucratic governance model that is vertically integrated (i.e., shared governance by members of each step of a value chain), and a social credit incentive system would overcome several known barriers to social goal achievement (e.g., such as power and hierarchy issues in decision making, donor-driven solutions that do not effectively or efficiently address needs, contract execution failures). The SPVC concept, the status of the software research prototype supporting it, and next steps will be discussed.",

Since then, we have built a digital art market that spans style, genre, geography, language, and more. Not only has the NFT ecosystem proven the value of digital art, it has also challenged the traditional art market, and in doing so found a place for digital art within the upper echelons of the art world.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in a world where there are millions (and one day trillions) of NFTs, how do we capture the history, the cultural significance, the very story of each piece of digital art?\r\n\r\n\r\nMint Gold Dust has always cared about the stories behind NFTs, which is why we pioneered the memoir feature, which is a piece of text that accompanies an artwork. But in our recently launched v2, we take it one step further. We preserve that memoir on the blockchain and tie it to the NFT artwork. For the archeologists of the future, NFTs minted on our platform will not only tell the visual story of our times, but also have a written counterpart onchain. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that this technology will help creators to preserve history and document the digital renaissance that we are witnessing before us today.",

The regulatory pressure for maintaining a mature risk and controls framework and having frequent inhouse audits over compliance with key requirements has become scrutinized and simply essential within the community. Lamentably, the crypto and blockchain communities are not too familiar with what a risk and controls framework is and how to perform an audit. Furthermore, not many are aware of core technology standards and global regulatory requirements as most of the attention has been over AML, sanction screening and transaction monitoring etc. while ignoring key Information Technology and Information Security standards. This workshop will walk the audience through the basics of risk and audit management, dive into what are some of the core IT and IS requirements for blockchain and crypto technology and also explore how to think about auditing internally before a regulatory examination.",

I love learning and trying new things, constantly exploring new avenues and expanding my mind in different dimensions. \r\n\r\nWith a Computer Science degree from UIUC, I've delved deep into the tech world, working as a software engineer at Facebook and as the Head of Product at small startups. Now, I'm sharing my technical expertise as a coach at Interview Kickstart, helping software engineers prepare for frontend engineering interviews at top tech companies.\r\n\r\nBut that's just one side of me.\r\n\r\nFor years, I've pursued my dreams of becoming a famous rapper, releasing albums and even pushed my limits by freestyle rapping for 38 minutes straight, which laid the foundation for my mixtape \"Better Than Before.\" I've hosted a podcast and built online communities. I've performed live as an improviser, a rap improviser, a rapper, and a stand up comedian. I've uploaded almost 800 videos to my YouTube channel and created thousands of ai-generated art. \r\n\r\nThrough it all, my breath has been my anchor, with a daily meditation practice complemented by 10-day intensive courses. With a sense of peace, purpose, and renewed clarity, I've transitioned into a career as a meditation and creativity coach. In a world that's constantly redefining itself, I’m here to guide leaders, especially from the tech and creative worlds, to stay centered and maximize the opportunities this era offers.\r\n\r\nIf you're a software engineer, builder, or creator looking for a bridge between logic and imagination, between code and artistry, let's connect. I'm here to be a bridge between dreams and reality.",
