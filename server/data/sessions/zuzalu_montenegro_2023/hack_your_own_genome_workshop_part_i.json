{"id":"hack_your_own_genome_workshop_part_i","name":"Hack your own genome workshop, part I","description":"The first part of the hack-your-own-genome workshop explains:\n* How and where can I sequence your genome?\n* How do health and longevity are connected with genetics? Which longevity genes do I have?\n* How can I analyze my or somebodies genome with open-source tools and libraries?\n* When I see an exciting gene or gene variant, how can I check it in my genome and interpret my genotype?\n* Most of the traits are polygenic. How can I evaluate my polygenic risk scores\n* Which types of genomic apps exist?\nThe talk will heavily utilize http://dna-seq.github.io/ open-source tools and apps that we develop.","start":null,"end":null,"stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"anton_kulaga","name":"Anton Kulaga","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/8a99mwho0kp0s5ot/index.m3u8","playbackId":"8a99mwho0kp0s5ot","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023"}
