He explains how he hired a team of 30 doctors to create a systematic protocol to achieve optimal health by measuring all his organs, generating hundreds of data markers, and repeating the protocol. Johnson also discusses the three principles of the blueprint effort: goal alignment, autonomous self, and zero principle. He believes that technology can be used to improve human well-being and that the relationship we have with technology should be reversed, with technology in service of human well-being. Johnson also talks about the rejuvenation Olympics, where people compete to improve their health, and how he is excited to see data that the blueprint works in other people's lives.","start":null,"end":null,"stageId":"dome","speakers":[{"id":"bryan_johnson","name":"Bryan Johnson","bio":"No description","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023","photo":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgx7EUb3gQqeYmesnBeljZVRhAE0cMsa/view?usp=sharing"}],"videoUrl":"https://lp-playback.com/hls/2ff99qlm7vhk9nvh/index.m3u8","playbackId":"2ff99qlm7vhk9nvh","eventId":"zuzalu_montenegro_2023"}
